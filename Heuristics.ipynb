        " \"question\": \"I'm having an issue with a Lean theorem prover code. It works fine when R is a CommRing, but fails when R is a Field. Here's the code:\\n\\nimport Mathlib\\n\\nopen Matrix\\n\\nvariable {m n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]\\n\\nexample {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [StarRing R] (A : unitaryGroup n R) (B : Matrix m n R) :\\n    rank (B * (A : Matrix n n R)) = rank B := by\\n  simp? -- simp only [UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit, rank_mul_eq_left_of_isUnit_det]\\n\\nexample {R : Type*} [Field R] [StarRing R] (A : unitaryGroup n R) (B : Matrix m n R) :\\n    rank (B * (A : Matrix n n R)) = rank B := by\\n  simp? -- fails with no progress\\n\\nCan you explain what's going on and how to fix it?\",\n",
        " \"answer\": \"The issue you're experiencing is due to a non-confluence in the simplification rules used by Lean's theorem prover. Let me explain the problem and provide a solution:\\n\\n1. Problem explanation:\\n   In the CommRing case, `simp?` successfully proves the theorem by applying the lemmas `UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit` and `rank_mul_eq_left_of_isUnit_det`.\\n\\n   However, in the Field case, the simplifier behaves differently. It rewrites the goal `IsUnit (↑A)` to `det (↑A) ≠ 0` using the lemma `isUnit_iff_ne_zero`. This rewrite prevents the application of `Matrix.UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit`, which would have discharged the goal in its original form.\\n\\n2. Solution:\\n   You can resolve this issue by explicitly preventing the problematic rewrite. Use the following code for the Field case:\\n\\n   ```lean\\n   example {R : Type*} [Field R] [StarRing R] (A : unitaryGroup n R) (B : Matrix m n R) :\\n       rank (B * (A : Matrix n n R)) = rank B := by\\n     simp [-isUnit_iff_ne_zero]\\n   ```\\n\\n   This solution works by instructing the simplifier not to use the `isUnit_iff_ne_zero` lemma, allowing it to apply `Matrix.UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit` as intended.\\n\\n3. Debugging and understanding the issue:\\n   To see what's happening behind the scenes with the simplifier, you can use the `trace.Meta.Tactic.simp` option. Add the following line at the beginning of your Lean file or just before the examples:\\n\\n   ```lean\\n   set_option trace.Meta.Tactic.simp true\\n   ```\\n\\n   This will output a trace of the simplifier's actions. In both cases, you'll see that `simp` correctly tries `rank_mul_eq_left_of_isUnit_det`, but in the Field case, it fails to discharge the hypothesis with `UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit` because it doesn't even seem to try to unify with this lemma after rewriting the goal.\\n\\n4. Root cause:\\n   In the Field case, the trace shows that it rewrote the discharging goal of `IsUnit (↑A)` to `det (↑A) ≠ 0` with the `isUnit_iff_ne_zero` lemma. This made it no longer try to discharge the goal with `Matrix.UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit` because the discharging goal no longer matched.\\n\\n5. Long-term considerations:\\n   This issue highlights a need to address non-confluence in the simplification set. Possible approaches include:\\n   - Adding `det (↑A) ≠ 0` as a simp lemma for better confluence.\\n   - Adjusting the priority of `Matrix.isUnit_iff_ne_zero` to be lower than `Unit.isUnit`.\\n\\n   The Lean community may need to reconsider the changes introduced in PR #12244 to find the best approach for handling such cases.\\n\\nBy using the solution provided (`simp [-isUnit_iff_ne_zero]`), your code should work consistently in both the CommRing and Field cases. This solution prevents the problematic rewrite, allowing the simplifier to use `Matrix.UnitaryGroup.det_isUnit` as intended in both scenarios.\",\n",

              "'Jon Eugster: I recently had an [issue report](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/issues/241) which essentially said that a user didn\\'t have `C++` on their Windows machine and therefore failed to build a lean package that used FFI (foreign\\\\-function\\\\-interface).\\n\\n\\nThe [FFI used in lean4\\\\-i18n](https://github.com/hhu-adam/lean-i18n/blob/e493a4f7f0d51b6707c9d11bd0488d2f26b58bd0/lakefile.lean#L30-L34) is following the [official example](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/1f732bb3b7fa8e93ca01c1b257668aee14d72d2d/src/lake/examples/ffi/lib/lakefile.lean#L14-L18):\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ntarget time.o pkg : FilePath := do\\n  let oFile := pkg.buildDir / \"c\" / \"time.o\"\\n  let srcJob ← inputFile <| pkg.dir / \"time\" / \"c\" / \"time.cpp\"\\n  let weakArgs := #[\"-I\", (← getLeanIncludeDir).toString]\\n  buildO oFile srcJob weakArgs #[\"-fPIC\"] \"c++\" getLeanTrace\\n\\n```\\n\\nFirst of all, is it typical for Windows users to not have `C++` available per default? And if so, what are the recommended instructions to fix this? Is there anything I could change on the setup to prevent beginners (on Windows) using the package to stumble across this error (`error: failed to execute `c++`: no such file or directory (error code: 2)`)?\\n\\n. Jon Eugster: I would also be happy if there was a way to just not use the FFI if it\\'s failing: It\\'s only used for a function printing the system time, and if I could set it up in a way that this function just returns `\"\"` if `C++` is not available, that would be satisfactory. But I assume that\\'s not possible, is it?\\n\\n. Richard Copley: No, Windows doesn\\'t have a \"c\\\\+\\\\+.exe\", by default. (Neither does Ubuntu!) The usual way to get a native Windows `g++` or `clang++` available as `c++` is to install MSYS2, but if the user doesn\\'t already know that, it\\'s a long path. I would suggest you recommend the user installs WSL2 and Ubuntu 24\\\\.04 and works there instead of in Windows (and installs `build-essentials` to get `c++`).\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, does it make sense to change \"`c++`\" to \"`leanc`\"?\\n\\n. Jon Eugster: Thanks for the explanation! Is `leanc` something that\\'s available for anybody using Lean? That does sound like the best approach, although I know nothing about these things.\\n\\n\\nIs there a reason the official documentation for FFI does not use `leanc` there?\\n\\n. Richard Copley: I don\\'t know details, but `leanc` is some kind of special build of `clang`, and it\\'s always installed with Lean 4\\\\. Maybe there\\'s a good reason not to use it as if it were a \\'normal\\' compiler.\\n\\n\\n(I don\\'t really understand how one expects to be able to make use of FFI without already knowing how to compile stuff. That\\'s probably a bit uncharitable of me.)\\n\\n. Jon Eugster: Actually, with `leanc` I don\\'t know how to do the imports, my example file was `time.cpp`:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n#include <time.h>\\n#include <string>\\n\\n#include <lean/lean.h>\\n\\nextern \"C\" lean_obj_res formatLocalTime() {\\n    time_t rawtime;\\n    struct tm *timeinfo;\\n    char buffer[80];\\n    time(&rawtime);\\n    timeinfo = localtime(&rawtime);\\n    strftime(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%c\", timeinfo);\\n    return lean_io_result_mk_ok(lean_mk_string(buffer));\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nSorry for not knowing a single thing about C/C\\\\+\\\\+ anymore, but with `leanc` it says\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ninfo: stderr:\\n././time/c/time.cpp:1:10: fatal error: \\'stdio.h\\' file not found\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n         ^~~~~~~~~\\n\\n```\\n\\ndo you know how to do these includes correctly?\\n\\n. Sebastian Ullrich: `leanc` is an implementation detail. Don\\'t use it.\\n\\n. Jon Eugster: ok good to know. But maybe I\\'ll just drop the feature which uses FFI if there isn\\'t any good way to make it work out of the box for everybody...\\n\\n\\nit\\'s not really an important feature anyways, just printing a timestamp into a translation file when it\\'s autogenerated...\\n\\n. Jz Pan: The Windows (in fact, also for Linux/Mac) version of Lean ships with a clang C\\\\+\\\\+ compiler. It comes with C/C\\\\+\\\\+ libraries, but not header files. You can look at this file <https://github.com/acmepjz/md4lean/blob/main/lakefile.lean> which uses it in an ad\\\\-hoc way.\\n\\n. Jz Pan: A possible solution is download a version of clang for Windows from its official website (<https://releases.llvm.org/>) and extract the header files. Hopefully the header files are of correct version.\\n\\n. Jon Eugster: thanks, especially the example shows some neat tricks, in particular `Platform.isWindows` and `← getLeanCc`. However, this seems all too complicated for the little benefits of my use case. I just commented\\\\-out everything related to FFI and moved on :sweat\\\\_smile:\\n\\n. '"

The `String` you passed to it is coerced to a `IO.Exception` and so since you didn't use the `tryCatch` implementation of the `IO` monad it propagated a `userError \"invalid arg\"` out of `main` and the runtime caught it.\n",

For example, I want to further divide the proof in lemmas, to prove them individually, but I can\\'t just apply the lemma to the specific pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nimport Mathlib.Data.Fin.Tuple.Reflection\\n\\nopen BigOperators\\n\\n-- # Need to achieve this proof for BigOperators\\nlemma min_sum_le_sum_min\\n  (A n B : ℕ)\\n  : min A (∑i:Fin n,B) ≤ ∑i:Fin n,min A B := by sorry -- deal with it later\\n\\ntheorem min_sum_le_sum_min_ite\\n  (A : ℕ)\\n  (xs : Fin n → Fin 2)\\n  (as : Fin n → ℕ × ℕ)\\n  : min A (∑ x : Fin n, if xs x = 1 then (as x).1 else (as x).2)\\n  ≤ (∑ x : Fin n, min A (if xs x = 1 then (as x).1 else (as x).2)) := by\\n  -- use the lemma in this specific case, where B depends on i\\n  apply min_sum_le_sum_min A n (B:=if xs _ = 1 then (as _).1 else (as _).2)\\n  /-\\n  tactic \\'apply\\' failed, failed to unify\\n    min A (∑ i : Fin n, if xs ?m.12973 = 1 then (as ?m.13003).1 else (as ?m.13008).2) ≤\\n      ∑ i : Fin n, min A (if xs ?m.12973 = 1 then (as ?m.13003).1 else (as ?m.13008).2)\\n  with\\n    min A (∑ x : Fin n, if xs x = 1 then (as x).1 else (as x).2) ≤\\n      ∑ x : Fin n, min A (if xs x = 1 then (as x).1 else (as x).2)\\n  -/\\n  done\\n\\n```\\n\\nWhat is the next step? `apply` is the right tactic or do I need something fancier, like `simp_rw` did?

Kevin Buzzard: That lemma doesn\\'t apply in your situation, because the variable `B` in it doesn\\'t depend on the `i` in the sum, it\\'s a constant natural, whereas `if xs x = 1 then (as x).1 else (as x).2` depends on `x`.\\n\\n. Bernardo Borges: How can I break the theorem apart in a smaller lemma?\\n\\n.

I would like to rewrite g(h) in the goal, but it\\'s not so easy because h is not a variable. I figured out how to do this with `conv`, but it doesn\\'t seem very efficient...

Eric Rodriguez: For the case you mention, [docs\\\\#funext](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=funext#doc) and then the rewrite should work\\n\\n. Ian Jauslin: I see, thank you! I did `rw[funext hfg]` and that works perfectly. Thanks!\\n\\n. David Loeffler: `simp_rw [hfg]` also works.\\n\\n.  // TRUE\\n\\nCONVERSATION 3: Yaël Dillies: This is a very speculative question. Are there interesting ways for topology and order to interact without algebra being involved? Let me expand.\\n\\n. Yaël Dillies: Fact: The upper closure of a closed set is closed.\\n\\n\\nThis is both true for the lower topology on a preorder ([\\\\#17037](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17037)), and for lower\\\\-bounded sets in ordered commutative topological (additive) groups (soon to be in [\\\\#16975](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16975)).\\n\\n. Yaël Dillies: Fact: The closure of an upper set is an upper set.\\n\\n\\nThis is true in ordered commutative topological (additive) groups ([\\\\#16975](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16975)) without change to the statement between the additive and multiplicative statements.\\n\\n. Yaël Dillies: Fact: `Ici a` is closed.\\n\\n\\nThis is both true for [docs\\\\#order\\\\_closed\\\\_topology](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/order_closed_topology) and the lower topology on a preorder.\\n\\n. Yaël Dillies: Is there any interesting pattern here besides the already\\\\-existing [docs\\\\#order\\\\_closed\\\\_topology](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/order_closed_topology) and [docs\\\\#order\\\\_topology](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/order_topology)?\\n\\n. Kevin Buzzard: Just to remark that a topological abelian group has a canonical uniform space structure inducing the topology, but I\\'m not sure this helps\\n\\n.  // FALSE\\n\\nCONVERSATION 4: Richard Kiss: I define `Node` with a custom `Repr` to reduce output size during proofs.\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ninductive Node\\n  | atom : Atom → Node\\n  | pair : Node → Node → Node\\n\\n\\ndef repr_node (n: Node) : String :=\\n  match n with\\n  | Node.atom a => b2h a.data\\n  | Node.pair a b => s!\"({repr_node a} . {repr_node b})\"\\n\\n\\ninstance : Repr Node where\\n  reprPrec (n : Node) (_ : Nat) := repr_node n\\n\\n```\\n\\nWhen I do `#eval n` where with `n: Node` my custom `Repr` works just fine. But in proofs it uses the default verbose `Node.pair ...`. What am I missing?\\n\\n. Michal Wallace (tangentstorm): I don\\'t know the answer, but what happens if you also implement `ToString`?\\n\\n. Richard Kiss: I gave it a shot, but it didn\\'t help. Looks like `#eval toString n` for `n: Node` does the same as `repr_node` except it puts double quotes around the whole thing\\n\\n. Daniel Weber: Could you make a [\\\\#mwe](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html)?

Richard Kiss: I\\'ll read up more on elaborator, delaborator and the pretty\\\\-printing link above.\\n\\n. Henrik Böving: Daniel Weber [said](#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Using.20custom.20.60Repr.60.20of.20inductive.20type/near/447398919):\\n\\n\\n\\n> Could you make a [\\\\#mwe](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html)? Anyway, I believe what you need is a delaborator, see [https://leanprover\\\\-community.github.io/lean4\\\\-metaprogramming\\\\-book/extra/03\\\\_pretty\\\\-printing.html](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean4-metaprogramming-book/extra/03_pretty-printing.html) .\\n\\n\\nThis is the correct direciton to go into.\\n\\n\\nThere are two distinct ways to look at a datatype. One is `Repr` which you can implement to turn a value of your type to a string at runtime of a program (which is what eval is simulating). The other is controlled by the delaborator which determines how Lean shows you values etc. in its interactive editing facilities such as the LSP. Both of these facilities are inherently disconnected.\\n\\n\\nFor your concrete use case you will need to put the delaborator on the constructor of `Atom`, `Atom.mk` instead of the type `Atom` which can of course have a custom interactive representation as well:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n@[app_unexpander Atom.mk]\\ndef unexpNodePair : Lean.PrettyPrinter.Unexpander\\n  | `($(_) $a) => `(($a))\\n  | _ => throw ()\\n\\n```\\n. Richard Kiss: got it! That worked. So I think I\\'m unblocked, thank you\\n\\n. Richard Kiss: is there a place I can read more about `@[...]` attributes? It smells like python decorators to me, but I haven\\'t seen a formal definition of what it means\\n\\n. Henrik Böving: They are called attributes and they are quite different from decorators. If you wish to know how they work internally you can read up on it in the meta programming book that is linked above. If you just wish to work with them the answer is approximately the following: Tagging a declaration with an attribute will put it into a sort of mini database (potentially with additional meta information, in the case of `app_unexpander` that meta information is `Atom.mk`) within a Lean meta programming extension which can then do a kind of job. For `app_unexpander` that extension is the (surprise) unexpander which is part of the delaborator.\\n\\n. Richard Kiss: on further reflection, this makes sense. During proofs, we have to revert to how `Atom` is defined in their original context rather than creating instances of `Atom` and `Repr`ing them.\\n\\n. Henrik Böving: Precisley, note that in proofs your terms may have variables in them that you got from e.g. a function argument. You cannot `Repr` these variables as they are opaque values, you are doing symbolic reasoning after all.\\n\\n.  // TRUE\\n\\nCONVERSATION 5: Winston Yin: Lean is fun because it gives that dopamine hit when I\\'m presented with \"Goals accomplished :tada:\". I must say that I miss the bigger, more colourful font in VSCode\\'s Lean3 infoview, compared to the more modest and plain one in Lean4\\\\. (Very low priority) Is it possible to implement that for the Lean4 extension? I argue that it is important to be able to quickly see with the corner of one\\'s eye if the current goal has been completed.\\n\\n. Martin Dvořák: I think we could jazz it up even more!\\n\\n. Sebastian Ullrich: In LeanInk I used my supervising authority to have :tada: swapped for :octopus: , which seemed even more fitting\\n\\n.

Kudryashov: Also, many lemmas (e.g., about [docs\\\\#Filter.atTop](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Filter.atTop#doc)) can be generalized from `SemilatticeSup` to `IsDirected`. They were written for semilattices because `IsDirected` wasn\\'t there back then.\\n\\n.

Kudryashov: @Christopher Hoskin We should have instances both for `(· ≤ ·)` and `(· ⊆ ·)`\\n\\n. Christopher Hoskin: Thanks. I was trying to add it [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/Data/Finset/Basic.lean#L308) after importing `Mathlib.Order.Directed`. The infer instance doesn\\'t seem to work though. If I put it in another file which imports `Mathlib.Order.Directed` and `Mathlib.Data.Finset.Basic` then it does work.\\n\\n. Yury G. Kudryashov: It should go after the `Lattice` instance\\n\\n. Christopher Hoskin: Okay, so I was now expecting to be able to do:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nlemma test (α : Type _) {s t : Finset α} : ∃ r, s ≤ r ∧ t ≤ r := by\\n  use (directed_of (· ⊆ ·) s t)\\n\\n```\\n\\nBut I get `failed to synthesize instance IsDirected (Finset α) fun x x_1 ↦ x ⊆ x_1`\\n\\n.

Yaël Dillies: At this point I would just suggest using `classical` and taking `f = f₁ ∪ f₂`.\\n\\n. Christopher Hoskin: Thanks, that works!

Specifically, how can one handle cases where the goal is not a 'Prop' and involves types like 'List' or 'Fin'? Additionally, what are more elegant ways to handle if-then-else chaining in such scenarios?\",\n",
        "  \"answer\": \"The 'cases' tactic in Lean is primarily used when the goal is a 'Prop', as it relies on the 'casesOn' method associated with inductive types, which is specialized for propositions. When the goal is not a 'Prop', such as when dealing with types like 'List' or 'Fin', the 'cases' tactic may not work due to type mismatches or other restrictions. In these situations, alternative approaches are necessary. For instance, you can use if-then-else chaining to handle different cases based on type equality. Here is an example of how to handle such cases elegantly without using 'cases':\\n\\n```lean\\ndef splitNoCases' {α β : Nat} (a : Fin α) (b : Fin β) (γ : Nat) (γ_def : γ ∈ [α, β]) : Fin γ :=\\n  if h : γ = α then\\n    Fin.cast h.symm a\\n  else if h' : γ = β then\\n    Fin.cast h'.symm b\\n  else\\n    by exfalso; simp at γ_def; tauto\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the 'if h : γ = α' construct is used to check if 'γ' is equal to 'α', and if so, 'Fin.cast h.symm a' is used to cast 'a' to the appropriate type. Similarly, 'if h' : γ = β' handles the case where 'γ' is equal to 'β'. If neither condition is met, the 'exfalso' tactic is used to derive a contradiction, leveraging 'simp' and 'tauto' to simplify and resolve the goal.\\n\\nThe main issue resolved here is the limitation of the 'cases' tactic when the goal is not a 'Prop'. The source of confusion was the restriction of 'cases' to propositions and how to handle goals involving other types. The issue was resolved by using if-then-else chaining and type casting with 'Fin.cast', providing a more elegant and functional approach to handle such cases.\")\n",

        "  \"answer\": 'To define a norm for an Octonion algebra over a field that correctly utilizes the star operation for each component, you need to ensure that the type `α` supports the star operation.

By adding the `[StarRing α]` constraint, you ensure that `α` supports the star operation. Additionally, marking the `Octonion.star` function as `protected` can prevent naming conflicts.

        "  \"answer\": \"The `rw` tactic in Lean does allow rewriting under quantifiers, but it has a specific limitation: the rewritten term cannot reference any of the bound variables within the quantifier. This can be confusing for beginners because it seems like `rw` should be able to rewrite in all contexts. The `simp_rw` tactic, on the other hand, uses the `simp` tactic internally, which employs different techniques that allow it to rewrite under binders more reliably. This is because `simp` can use functional extensionality (`funext`) to navigate into subexpressions within binders, something `rw` cannot do as effectively. However, `simp` can only rewrite one thing at a time, which can be a limitation in cases involving complicated dependent types. Additionally, in Lean's type theory, functional extensionality does not hold without an additional axiom (`quot.sound`), which is necessary for rewriting under a lambda. This distinction is crucial for understanding why `rw` and `simp_rw` behave differently and how to use them appropriately in different contexts. For more detailed explanations, you can refer to discussions on the Lean community forums or consider creating a FAQ page for quick reference.\",\n",

Do I have to make a newtype wrapper, like this: structure XorNat where n : Nat instance : Group XorNat where ... If I do this, it seems that in order to define the instance, I have to constantly wrap/unwrap to use the properties of xor. Is there a way around this to reduce the amount of boilerplate?\",\n",
            "\"answer\": \"To reduce boilerplate, you can define `XorNat` as a newtype wrapper for `Nat` and then create a group instance for `XorNat`. When defining the group instance, it's recommended to define `mul` and `one` separately before proceeding with other properties like `mul_assoc`, `one_mul`, `mul_one`, `inv`, and `mul_left_inv`. By setting up the basic lemmas first, such as `Nat.zero_xor`, you can ensure that the properties are correctly applied. Additionally, naming the instance as `XorNat.instgroup` can help avoid the need to constantly open `XorNat` in your definitions.\",\n",

              "  \"When the `refl` tactic fails to prove an equality involving wildcards in Lean 3, it indicates that the terms on both sides of the equality are not syntactically identical, even though they should be equal by definition.

However, this can sometimes result in very verbose output. Another useful option is `set_option pp.implicit true`, which displays implicit arguments but might still leave some parts as wildcards.

The 'calc' block is designed to chain together multiple steps that are proved by different tactics. However, if a statement can be proved in one step, you can generally write the tactic without the scaffolding of a 'calc' block. For example, consider the following proof involving inequalities and the 'calc' block from 'The Mechanics of Proof' by Heather Macbeth: ```lean example {r s : ℚ} (h1 : s + 3 ≥ r) (h2 : s + r ≤ 3) : r ≤ 3 := by have h3 : r ≤ 3 + s := by addarith[h1] have h4 : r ≤ 3 - s := by addarith [h2] calc r = (r + r) / 2 := by ring _ ≤ (3 - s + (3 + s)) / 2 := by rel [h4, h3] _ = 3 := by ring ``` In this example, the first two lines within the 'calc' block use 'r = r', which feels redundant. Instead, you can simplify the proof by directly using the 'addarith' tactic: ```lean example {r s : ℚ} (h1 : s + 3 ≥ r) (h2 : s + r ≤ 3) : r ≤ 3 := by have h3 : r ≤ 3 + s := by addarith[h1] have h4 : r ≤ 3 - s := by addarith [h2] calc r = (r + r) / 2 := by ring _ ≤ (3 - s + (3 + s)) / 2 := by rel [h4, h3] _ = 3 := by ring ``` This approach is simpler and more idiomatic.

These functions appear to have overlapping functionalities. Could you clarify the naming conventions for these functions and explain the rationale behind their current names? Additionally, is there any opposition to renaming these functions to better align with the established conventions?\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"answer\\\\\": \\\\\"The functions `Option.elim`, `Option.elim\\'`, and `Option.casesOn\\'` in Lean are indeed closely related, and their naming conventions can be confusing. Here is a detailed explanation of the naming conventions and the rationale behind them, along with a proposal for renaming these functions to better align with the conventions. The general pattern for naming recursors in Lean is as follows: - `Option.rec`: This is a dependent recursor with the type `\\\\u2200 o : Option \\\\u03b1, motive none \\\\u2192 (\\\\u2200 a : \\\\u03b1, motive (some a)) \\\\u2192 motive o`. - `Option.recOn`: This is another dependent recursor with the type `motive none \\\\u2192 (\\\\u2200 a : \\\\u03b1, motive (some a)) \\\\u2192 \\\\u2200 o : Option \\\\u03b1, motive o`. - `Option.casesOn`: This is a non-dependent recursor with the type `Option \\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2 \\\\u2192 (\\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2) \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2`. However, this function is currently named `Option.casesOn\\'` and also `Option.elim`. - `Option.elim`: This is another non-dependent recursor with the type `\\\\u03b2 \\\\u2192 (\\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2) \\\\u2192 Option \\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2`. However, this function is currently named `Option.elim\\'`. The suffix `On` indicates that the inductive type argument comes first, `rec` indicates a dependent recursor, and `elim`/`cases` indicate a non-dependent recursor. The current naming of these functions is inconsistent with these conventions. Specifically, `Option.casesOn` should be the non-dependent recursor with the type `Option \\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2 \\\\u2192 (\\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2) \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2`, and `Option.elim` should be the non-dependent recursor with the type `\\\\u03b2 \\\\u2192 (\\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2) \\\\u2192 Option \\\\u03b1 \\\\u2192 \\\\u03b2`. There is a proposal to clean up this naming inconsistency. The main issue resolved here is the inconsistency in the naming of the `Option` recursors. The source of confusion was the overlapping functionalities and the incorrect naming of the functions.

The goal is to represent elements of a matrix and its inverse using this notation. The initial attempt involved using custom notations, but it faced limitations with Greek letters. Here is the initial code snippet:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nnotation \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u03b7\\\\u207d\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mu \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u207e\\\\u207d\\\\\\\\\\\\\" nu \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u207e\\\\\\\\\\\\\"   => \\\\u03b7 mu nu\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nnotation \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u03b7\\\\u208d\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mu \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u208e\\\\u208d\\\\\\\\\\\\\" nu \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u208e\\\\\\\\\\\\\"   => \\\\u03b7\\\\u207b\\\\u00b9 mu nu\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat are the possible solutions or workarounds to achieve this in Lean?\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"answer\\\\\": \\\\\"To implement Einstein notation in Lean, particularly for subscript and superscript Greek indices, you can use custom notations and macros. The initial attempt using custom notations faced limitations due to the lack of support for Greek letters in UTF-8. Here is an improved approach using macros and a more flexible notation system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nmacro \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u03b7\\\\u207d\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mu:superscript(term) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u207e\\\\u207d\\\\\\\\\\\\\" nu:superscript(term) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u207e\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  : term  => \\\\u03b7 mu nu\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis macro allows you to use superscript notation for indices. However, it still does not fully support Greek letters. A more comprehensive solution involves creating a small domain-specific language (DSL) for Einstein notation. This DSL can use a notation similar to LaTeX, such as `\\\\u03b7^[a b]_[c]^[d]`, to represent the indices. Here is an example of how you can define such a notation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nnotation \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u03b7^[\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a \\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\" b \\\\\\\\\\\\\"]_[\\\\\\\\\\\\\" c \\\\\\\\\\\\\"]^[\\\\\\\\\\\\\" d \\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\u03b7 a b c d\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis notation allows you to write `\\\\u03b7^[a b]_[c]^[d]` to mean `\\\\u03b7^{ab}_{c}^{d}`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` can be symbols or specific values. This approach provides a more readable and flexible way to represent Einstein notation in Lean.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main issue resolved here is the limitation of UTF-8 in representing Greek letters for subscript and superscript indices. The source of confusion was the inability to use Greek letters directly in the notation.

Specifically, what causes the ambiguity, and what are the steps to resolve it? Additionally, how should one handle deprecated functions like `nthLe` in theorem statements?\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"answer\\\\\": \\\\\"The ambiguity error when using the `isPrefix` notation in Lean arises because the notation ` <+: ` is declared twice, once in `Std.Data.List.Basic` and once in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`. This causes Lean to interpret the notation in multiple ways, leading to ambiguity. To resolve this, you can remove one of the conflicting declarations. For instance, you can delete the line in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs` to avoid the conflict. Here is a step-by-step solution to resolve the ambiguity error and handle deprecated functions like `nthLe` in theorem statements:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Identify the Source of Ambiguity**: The error message indicates that the notation ` <+: ` is ambiguous because it is declared twice. This can be confirmed by checking the files `Std.Data.List.Basic` and `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Remove the Conflicting Declaration**: To resolve the ambiguity, you can remove the conflicting declaration from one of the files. For example, you can delete the line `infixl:50 \\\\\" \\\\t, \\\\\" => isPrefix` in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Verify the Resolution**: After removing the conflicting declaration, verify that the ambiguity error is resolved by recompiling the code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Handle Deprecated Functions**: For deprecated functions like `nthLe`, it is recommended to deprecate the theorems that use them rather than changing them. This ensures that theorems remain consistent with the current best practices.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere is an example of how to handle the ambiguity error and deprecated functions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lean\\\\\\\\nimport Mathlib.Data.List.Basic\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nset_option pp.notation false in\\\\\\\\nset_option pp.explicit true in\\\\\\\\nexample (xs : List Nat) : xs <+: xs := sorry\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, the ambiguity error is resolved by ensuring that the notation ` <+: ` is declared only once. For deprecated functions like `nthLe`, you can mark the theorems as deprecated instead of changing them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main issue resolved here is the ambiguity caused by multiple declarations of the same notation. The source of confusion was the presence of conflicting declarations in different files. The issue was resolved by removing one of the conflicting declarations. Additionally, deprecated functions like `nthLe` should be marked as deprecated rather than changed to maintain consistency with current best practices.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy following these steps, you can resolve the ambiguity error and handle deprecated functions in Lean theorem statements effectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lean\\\\\\\\n-- Example of removing conflicting declaration\\\\\\\\n-- In Mathlib.Data.List.Defs\\\\\\\\n-- infixl:50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\" <+: \\\\\\\\\\\\\" => isPrefix  -- Remove this line\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Example of marking deprecated functions\\\\\\\\n-- In your theorem statements\\\\\\\\n@[deprecated] theorem oldTheoremUsingNthLe : ... := ...\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\t:\\\\n  \\\\\"keywords\\\\\"\\\\t\\\\t,\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\"keyword\\\\\"\\\\t\\\\t:\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\"ambiguity error\\\\\"\\\\t\\\\t,\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\"rationale\\\\\"\\\\t\\\\t:\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\"The ambiguity error is the central issue in the question.

\\\\\"In Lean, how can one create completely transparent abbreviations using an alternative to the mathlib notation, and what are the challenges associated with zero-argument abbreviations? Additionally, how can one ensure that the terminfo is preserved after unfolding, and how can an unexpander be created similar to the `notation` command? Here is an example of the desired behavior and the partial implementation provided:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lean\\\\\\\\n@[elab_inline]\\\\\\\\ndef f (x : Nat) := 2 * x\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#check f 37\\\\\\\\n-- 2 * 37 : Nat\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe goal is to have any application of `f` immediately unfolded after elaboration.

Additionally, the terminfo is not preserved after unfolding, and an unexpander similar to `notation` is desired.

The provided implementation demonstrates this approach with a simple example. However, there are several challenges associated with this method, particularly with zero-argument abbreviations and preserving terminfo after unfolding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main issue with zero-argument abbreviations, such as `@[elab_inline] def random : Nat := 37`, is that the macro `macro_rules | `(random) => `(unfold% random)` does not fire. This can be resolved by ensuring that the macro pattern correctly matches the zero-argument case. Additionally, preserving terminfo after unfolding can be addressed by modifying the elaboration process to retain the necessary information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo create an unexpander similar to the `notation` command, you can extend the macro rules to handle the desired syntax. Here is a revised implementation that addresses these challenges:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lean\\\\\\\\nimport Lean\\\\\\\\nimport Std.Lean.Command\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nopen Lean Meta Elab\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsyntax (name := unfold) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"unfold% \\\\\\\\\\\\\" ident term:max* : term\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@[term_elab unfold] def elabUnfold : Elab.Term.TermElab := fun stx expectedType? => do\\\\\\\\n  match stx with\\\\\\\\n  | `(unfold% $f $[$args]*) =>\\\\\\\\n    let some f \\\\u2190 Term.resolveId? f | throwUnknownConstant f.getId\\\\\\\\n    let e \\\\u2190 Term.elabAppArgs f #[] (args.map .stx) expectedType?\\\\\\\\n      (explicit := false) (ellipsis := false)\\\\\\\\n    unfoldDefinition e\\\\\\\\n  | _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n/-- Causes the definition to be unfolded during elaboration. -/\\\\\\\\nsyntax (name := elab_inline) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"elab_inline\\\\\\\\\\\\\" : attr\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ninitialize registerBuiltinAttribute {\\\\\\\\n  name := `elab_inline\\\\\\\\n  descr := \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  applicationTime := .afterCompilation,\\\\\\\\n  add := fun src ref kind => do\\\\\\\\n    if (kind != AttributeKind.global) then\\\\\\\\n      throwError \\\\\\\\\\\\\"`elab_inline` can only be used as a global attribute\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    liftCommandElabM <| withRef ref <| Command.elabCommand (\\\\u2190 `(command|\\\\\\\\n      macro_rules\\\\\\\\n      | `($(mkIdent src)) => `(unfold% $(mkIdent src))\\\\\\\\n      | `($(mkIdent src) $$args*) => `(unfold% $(mkIdent src) $$args*))) }\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main issue resolved here is the inability of the macro to handle zero-argument abbreviations. The source of confusion was the macro pattern not matching the zero-argument case. The issue was resolved by ensuring the macro pattern correctly matches and handles zero-argument cases.

The arguments for each naming choice are as follows: `mkPair` and `unPair` were considered to maintain visual consistency, even though `unPair` is not a common term. `mkPair` and `unpair` were considered to follow the convention of using camel case for constructor-like functions and keeping `unpair` as a single word. `pair` and `unpair` were suggested to avoid the `mk` prefix, which implies a constructor, even though there is no type or constructor `Pair`/`pair`. The final decision was to use `mkPair` and `unpair`, aligning with the convention of camel case for constructor-like functions and keeping `unpair` as a single word. This decision was made to ensure consistency and clarity. To resolve conflicts with existing names, particularly in `Computability.Primrec`, the existing lemmas named `mkpair` were renamed to `nat_pair`, and explicit usage of `Nat.pair` was employed in some places.

In the provided code, the notations `\\\\u2297\\\\u2081` and `\\\\u2297\\\\u2082` are defined as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lean\\\\\\\\ninfix:70 \\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\u2297\\\\u2081 \\\\\\\\\\\\\" => (\\\\u00b7 * \\\\u00b7)\\\\\\\\ninfix:70 \\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\u2297\\\\u2082 \\\\\\\\\\\\\" => Mul.mul\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nvariable (\\\\u03a6 : Type) [Mul \\\\u03a6] (\\\\u03c6 \\\\u03c8 : \\\\u03a6)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#check \\\\u03c6 \\\\u2297\\\\u2081 \\\\u03c8\\\\\\\\n#check \\\\u03c6 \\\\u2297\\\\u2082 \\\\u03c8\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe issue arises because `\\\\u2297\\\\u2081` does not delaborate back to the notation, while `\\\\u2297\\\\u2082` does. This discrepancy is due to the fact that `\\\\u2297\\\\u2081` expands into a lambda expression that the pretty printer generator does not recognize, whereas `\\\\u2297\\\\u2082` directly maps to `Mul.mul`, which is recognized by the pretty printer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo resolve this, you can use the `notation3` command, which ensures that the notation delaborates correctly.

Specifically, how does renaming constructors help in documentation, natural naming, and creating smart constructors?\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"answer\\\\\": \\\\\"Renaming the constructor of a structure in Lean can be beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for better documentation. By giving the constructor a meaningful name, it becomes easier to understand the purpose and usage of the structure. For example, in the case of `And.intro`, the name `intro` is more descriptive than a generic name like `mk`, making it clearer that this constructor introduces an instance of the `And` type. Secondly, renaming constructors can make the code more natural and intuitive. For instance, `ULift.up` is a more intuitive name than a generic `mk`, as it clearly indicates the action of lifting a value. Thirdly, renaming constructors can facilitate the creation of smart constructors. A smart constructor is a function that performs additional checks or computations before creating an instance of the structure. By renaming the default constructor, you can create a smart constructor with the original name, while the renamed constructor can be used internally. For example, in the case of `Rat.mk`, the smart constructor `mkRat` performs additional validation to ensure the rational number is in its simplest form. This practice helps in maintaining clean and understandable code while providing additional functionality. In summary, renaming constructors in Lean can enhance documentation, provide more natural naming, and enable the creation of smart constructors, leading to more readable and maintainable code.\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"keywords\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"documentation\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Renaming constructors allows for attaching meaningful names that improve the readability and understanding of the code.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"natural naming\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Using intuitive names for constructors makes the code more natural and easier to follow.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"smart constructors\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Renaming constructors facilitates the creation of smart constructors that can perform additional checks or computations.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"And.intro\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"An example where renaming the constructor to `intro` makes it clearer that it introduces an instance of the `And` type.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"ULift.up\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"An example where the name `up` is more intuitive than a generic `mk`, indicating the action of lifting a value.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"Rat.mk\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"An example where the smart constructor `mkRat` performs additional validation, demonstrating the utility of renaming constructors.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"re-export\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Renaming constructors can be useful when re-exporting them, making the names more meaningful in different contexts.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"private constructor\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Renaming constructors can help in making the default constructor private, allowing for controlled creation of instances.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"mathlib\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"The Lean mathematical library (mathlib) contains several examples of renamed constructors, providing practical references.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"constructor function\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Renaming constructors can distinguish between the default constructor and additional constructor functions with specific purposes.\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\"}, \"logprobs\": null, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}], \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 3147, \"completion_tokens\": 717, \"total_tokens\": 3864}, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_400f27fa1f\"}}, \"error\": null}\\n', '_req_38JAnmSOl1GcR5xPVOj0zxAa\", \"custom_id\": \"request-8\", \"response\": {\"status_code\": 200, \"request_id\": \"ba48190f4a381c7f046ba16bea88ce07\", \"body\": {\"id\": \"chatcmpl-9oksSvCGhvonbZCJcuEDa2DWrtrYe\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"created\": 1721883624, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\", \"choices\": [{\"index\": 0, \"message\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{\\\\n  \\\\\"question\\\\\": \\\\\"In Lean\\'s mathlib, why is it often preferred to define instance declarations by referencing separately defined functions rather than directly within the instance?

Firstly, defining functions separately allows for better modularity and reusability. When a function is defined separately, it can be referenced in multiple places without duplicating code, which enhances maintainability. Additionally, this approach can improve compilation times. The Lean compiler tends to inline instance definitions, and having a separate definition can prevent the compiler from inlining complex definitions, which can save significant compilation time, especially for large or complicated expressions. For example, a big `match` expression can be defined once and reused, avoiding repeated inlining and thus reducing compilation overhead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, using separately defined functions can help avoid issues with typeclass resolution. When instances are defined directly, the compiler may need to perform additional typeclass lookups, which can be avoided by directly calling the function. This can lead to more efficient code execution. However, it is important to note that this is not always a performance optimization, as it can sometimes lead to a false economy. For instance, if the function `Foo.toString` is used directly, there may be fewer theorems and lemmas available for it compared to the standard `toString` method, which can make formal reasoning about the code more difficult.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, the preference for separately defined functions in instance declarations is driven by considerations of modularity, maintainability, and potential performance improvements in compilation. However, it is essential to balance these benefits with the need for formal reasoning and theorem proving within the Lean environment.\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"keywords\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"modularity\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Separately defined functions enhance modularity by allowing functions to be reused across different instances and contexts without duplicating code.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"maintainability\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Defining functions separately improves maintainability by making the codebase easier to manage and update, as changes to the function need to be made in only one place.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"compilation time\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Separately defined functions can prevent the compiler from inlining complex definitions, which can significantly reduce compilation time, especially for large or complicated expressions.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"typeclass resolution\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Using separately defined functions can avoid additional typeclass lookups, leading to more efficient code execution.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"formal reasoning\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Directly using standard methods like `toString` ensures that more theorems and lemmas are available for formal reasoning, which is crucial in a proof assistant environment like Lean.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"instance declarations\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"The discussion revolves around the best practices for defining instance declarations in Lean, making this keyword central to the topic.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"inlining\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Inlining is a key concept in understanding the performance implications of defining functions separately versus directly within instances.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"match expression\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"Complex definitions, such as those involving `match` expressions, benefit significantly from being defined separately to avoid repeated inlining.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"theorem proving\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"The availability of theorems and lemmas for standard methods is crucial for formal reasoning and theorem proving in Lean.\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"mathlib\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"The context of the discussion is within Lean\\'s mathlib, making this keyword relevant to the specific practices and conventions being discussed.\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\"}, \"logprobs\": null, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}], \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 3296, \"completion_tokens\": 912, \"total_tokens\": 4208}, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_400f27fa1f\"}}, \"error\": null}\\n', '_req_Y9Gbp3o1F6mmwzJE1HSKdY9Q\", \"custom_id\": \"request-9\", \"response\": {\"status_code\": 200, \"request_id\": \"3962cf7669722acf7e28528e82a66abb\", \"body\": {\"id\": \"chatcmpl-9oksSynbUFNULjE1hbo2VXrdD7vKo\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"created\": 1721883624, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\", \"choices\": [{\"index\": 0, \"message\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{\\\\n  \\\\\"question\\\\\": \\\\\"How can one define a function in Lean using an emoji as its name, specifically for the `Finmap.lookup` function?

Here is a detailed explanation of the naming conventions and the rationale behind them, along with a proposal for renaming these functions to better align with the conventions. The general pattern for naming recursors in Lean is as follows: - `Option.rec`: This is a dependent recursor with the type `∀ o : Option α, motive none → (∀ a : α, motive (some a)) → motive o`. - `Option.recOn`: This is another dependent recursor with the type `motive none → (∀ a : α, motive (some a)) → ∀ o : Option α, motive o`. - `Option.casesOn`: This is a non-dependent recursor with the type `Option α → β → (α → β) → β`. However, this function is currently named `Option.casesOn\\'` and also `Option.elim`. - `Option.elim`: This is another non-dependent recursor with the type `β → (α → β) → Option α → β`. However, this function is currently named `Option.elim\\'`. The suffix `On` indicates that the inductive type argument comes first, `rec` indicates a dependent recursor, and `elim`/`cases` indicate a non-dependent recursor. The current naming of these functions is inconsistent with these conventions. Specifically, `Option.casesOn` should be the non-dependent recursor with the type `Option α → β → (α → β) → β`, and `Option.elim` should be the non-dependent recursor with the type `β → (α → β) → Option α → β`. There is a proposal to clean up this naming inconsistency. The main issue resolved here is the inconsistency in the naming of the `Option` recursors.

Specifically, what causes the ambiguity, and what are the steps to resolve it? Additionally, how should one handle deprecated functions like `nthLe` in theorem statements?\",\\n  \"answer\": \"The ambiguity error when using the `isPrefix` notation in Lean arises because the notation ` <+: ` is declared twice, once in `Std.Data.List.Basic` and once in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`. This causes Lean to interpret the notation in multiple ways, leading to ambiguity. To resolve this, you can remove one of the conflicting declarations. For instance, you can delete the line in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs` to avoid the conflict. Here is a step-by-step solution to resolve the ambiguity error and handle deprecated functions like `nthLe` in theorem statements:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Identify the Source of Ambiguity**: The error message indicates that the notation ` <+: ` is ambiguous because it is declared twice. This can be confirmed by checking the files `Std.Data.List.Basic` and `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Remove the Conflicting Declaration**: To resolve the ambiguity, you can remove the conflicting declaration from one of the files. For example, you can delete the line `infixl:50 \" \\t, \" => isPrefix` in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Verify the Resolution**: After removing the conflicting declaration, verify that the ambiguity error is resolved by recompiling the code.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Handle Deprecated Functions**: For deprecated functions like `nthLe`, it is recommended to deprecate the theorems that use them rather than changing them. This ensures that theorems remain consistent with the current best practices.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example of how to handle the ambiguity error and deprecated functions:\\\\n\\\\n```lean\\\\nimport Mathlib.Data.List.Basic\\\\n\\\\nset_option pp.notation false in\\\\nset_option pp.explicit true in\\\\nexample (xs : List Nat) : xs <+: xs := sorry\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the ambiguity error is resolved by ensuring that the notation ` <+: ` is declared only once. For deprecated functions like `nthLe`, you can mark the theorems as deprecated instead of changing them.\\\\n\\\\nThe main issue resolved here is the ambiguity caused by multiple declarations of the same notation. The source of confusion was the presence of conflicting declarations in different files. The issue was resolved by removing one of the conflicting declarations. Additionally, deprecated functions like `nthLe` should be marked as deprecated rather than changed to maintain consistency with current best practices.\\\\n\\\\nBy following these steps, you can resolve the ambiguity error and handle deprecated functions in Lean theorem statements effectively.\\\\n\\\\n```lean\\\\n-- Example of removing conflicting declaration\\\\n-- In Mathlib.Data.List.Defs\\\\n-- infixl:50 \\\\\" <+: \\\\\" => isPrefix  -- Remove this line\\\\n\\\\n-- Example of marking deprecated functions\\\\n-- In your theorem statements\\\\n@[deprecated] theorem oldTheoremUsingNthLe : ... := ...\\\\n```\"\\n  \\t:\\n  \"keywords\"\\t\\t,\\t\\t\"keyword\"\\t\\t:\\t\\t\"ambiguity error\"\\t\\t,\\t\\t\"rationale\"\\t\\t:\\t\\t\"The ambiguity error is the central issue in the question.

Firstly, it allows for better documentation. By giving the constructor a meaningful name, it becomes easier to understand the purpose and usage of the structure. For example, in the case of `And.intro`, the name `intro` is more descriptive than a generic name like `mk`, making it clearer that this constructor introduces an instance of the `And` type. Secondly, renaming constructors can make the code more natural and intuitive. For instance, `ULift.up` is a more intuitive name than a generic `mk`, as it clearly indicates the action of lifting a value. Thirdly, renaming constructors can facilitate the creation of smart constructors. A smart constructor is a function that performs additional checks or computations before creating an instance of the structure. By renaming the default constructor, you can create a smart constructor with the original name, while the renamed constructor can be used internally. For example, in the case of `Rat.mk`, the smart constructor `mkRat` performs additional validation to ensure the rational number is in its simplest form. This practice helps in maintaining clean and understandable code while providing additional functionality.

Firstly, defining functions separately allows for better modularity and reusability. When a function is defined separately, it can be referenced in multiple places without duplicating code, which enhances maintainability. Additionally, this approach can improve compilation times. The Lean compiler tends to inline instance definitions, and having a separate definition can prevent the compiler from inlining complex definitions, which can save significant compilation time, especially for large or complicated expressions. For example, a big `match` expression can be defined once and reused, avoiding repeated inlining and thus reducing compilation overhead.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, using separately defined functions can help avoid issues with typeclass resolution. When instances are defined directly, the compiler may need to perform additional typeclass lookups, which can be avoided by directly calling the function. This can lead to more efficient code execution. However, it is important to note that this is not always a performance optimization, as it can sometimes lead to a false economy. For instance, if the function `Foo.toString` is used directly, there may be fewer theorems and lemmas available for it compared to the standard `toString` method, which can make formal reasoning about the code more difficult.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the preference for separately defined functions in instance declarations is driven by considerations of modularity, maintainability, and potential performance improvements in compilation.

Here is a step-by-step solution to resolve the ambiguity error and handle deprecated functions like `nthLe` in theorem statements:\\n\\n1. **Identify the Source of Ambiguity**: The error message indicates that the notation ` <+: ` is ambiguous because it is declared twice. This can be confirmed by checking the files `Std.Data.List.Basic` and `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`.\\n\\n2. **Remove the Conflicting Declaration**: To resolve the ambiguity, you can remove the conflicting declaration from one of the files. For example, you can delete the line `infixl:50 \" \t, \" => isPrefix` in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`.\\n\\n3. **Verify the Resolution**: After removing the conflicting declaration, verify that the ambiguity error is resolved by recompiling the code.\\n\\n4. **Handle Deprecated Functions**: For deprecated functions like `nthLe`, it is recommended to deprecate the theorems that use them rather than changing them. This ensures that theorems remain consistent with the current best practices.\\n\\nHere is an example of how to handle the ambiguity error and deprecated functions:\\n\\n```lean\\nimport Mathlib.Data.List.Basic\\n\\nset_option pp.notation false in\\nset_option pp.explicit true in\\nexample (xs : List Nat) : xs <+: xs := sorry\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the ambiguity error is resolved by ensuring that the notation ` <+: ` is declared only once. For deprecated functions like `nthLe`, you can mark the theorems as deprecated instead of changing them.\\n\\nThe main issue resolved here is the ambiguity caused by multiple declarations of the same notation. The source of confusion was the presence of conflicting declarations in different files. The issue was resolved by removing one of the conflicting declarations. Additionally, deprecated functions like `nthLe` should be marked as deprecated rather than changed to maintain consistency with current best practices.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can resolve the ambiguity error and handle deprecated functions in Lean theorem statements effectively.\\n\\n```lean\\n-- Example of removing conflicting declaration\\n-- In Mathlib.Data.List.Defs\\n-- infixl:50 \\\" <+: \\\" => isPrefix  -- Remove this line\\n\\n-- Example of marking deprecated functions\\n-- In your theorem statements\\n@[deprecated] theorem oldTheoremUsingNthLe : ... := ...\\n```\"  \t:  \"keywords\"\t\t,\t\t\"keyword\"\t\t:\t\t\"ambiguity error\"\t\t,\t\t\"rationale\"\t\t:\t\t\"The ambiguity error is the central issue in the question.

In the provided code snippet:\\n\\n```lean\\ndef loops : IO Unit := do\\n  while true do\\n    pure ()\\n```\\n\\nThe function 'loops' does not call itself directly, so it does not need to be marked as 'partial'. The 'while' loop itself is defined using a partial function, but since 'loops' only calls this definition and does not involve direct recursion, the 'partial' keyword is not required.\\n\\nTo ensure that functions terminate, you can use tail-recursion and provide a manual proof of termination. Alternatively, you can use constructs that inherently require termination proofs. For example, instead of using 'while', you can use a recursive function with a well-founded relation to prove that it terminates. Here is an example of how you might rewrite the 'loops' function to ensure termination:\\n\\n```lean\\ndef loops (n : Nat) : IO Unit :=\\n  if n = 0 then\\n    pure ()\\n  else\\n    loops (n - 1)\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the function 'loops' takes a natural number 'n' and decrements it with each recursive call, ensuring that it eventually terminates when 'n' reaches zero. This approach requires a proof that the recursion is well-founded, which Lean can verify.\\n\\nThe main issue resolved here is understanding why the 'partial' keyword is not required for nonterminating functions that do not involve direct recursion.

              "  'answer': 'To write a command in Lean that prints the current namespace, you can use the `elab`, `CoreM`, `logInfo`, and `getCurrNamespace` functions. The `getCurrNamespace` function retrieves the current namespace, and `logInfo` can be used to print it. Here is a step-by-step solution to achieve this, including how to handle different namespaces and convert the output to a string for printing purposes. First, ensure you import the necessary Lean modules. Then, define a command using `run_cmd` to log the current namespace. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach within a specific namespace and how to make it work across different namespaces by using the `Lean.` prefix or the `open Lean` command to avoid prefixing each function call with `Lean.`. The following code shows how to print the current namespace within the `Foo` namespace and globally: ```lean import Lean namespace Foo run_cmd Lean.logInfo (← Lean.getCurrNamespace) end Foo ``` Alternatively, you can use the `open Lean` command to simplify the code: ```lean import Lean open Lean namespace Foo run_cmd logInfo (← getCurrNamespace) end Foo ``` The main issue resolved here is how to print the current namespace in Lean using the appropriate functions. The source of confusion was how to combine `elab`, `CoreM`, `logInfo`, and `getCurrNamespace` to achieve this.

              "  'answer': 'The issue with your function `erace_curr` arises because defining custom functions on `string.iterator` is not fully supported in Lean. The `string.iterator` type is primarily intended to interface with string operations written in C++, and using it in custom functions can lead to unexpected behavior, such as non-termination. \\n\\nTo achieve the desired functionality of erasing specific characters from a string, you can use a more straightforward and supported approach by converting the string to a list, filtering out the unwanted characters, and then converting it back to a string. Here is an example of how to do this:\\n\\n```lean\\n#eval (\"1234\\\\n567\".to_list.filter (≠ \\'\\\\n\\')).as_string\\n#eval (\"α\".to_list.filter (≠ \\'\\\\n\\')).as_string\\n```\\n\\nIn this solution, `to_list` converts the string to a list of characters, `filter (≠ \\'\\\\n\\')` removes all occurrences of the newline character, and `as_string` converts the list back to a string. This approach is both elegant and reliable, avoiding the pitfalls of using `string.iterator` for custom operations.\\n\\nThe main issue resolved here is the non-termination of the custom function when using `string.iterator`.

Additionally, what are the limitations of these tools, and are there any recent developments that might offer better functionality?\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"answer\\\\\": \\\\\"In Lean 4, there isn\\'t a direct equivalent to Coq\\'s `Search` tactic. However, there are several tools and tactics that can help you find relevant theorems or definitions. The primary tools available are `library_search` and `squeeze_simp`. The `library_search` tactic attempts to find a lemma in the library that can close the current goal. While it is useful, it has limitations, particularly when it cannot complete the proof on its own. To use `library_search` effectively, you need to provide it with a statement that closely matches what you are looking for. This tactic works by searching for lemmas that can be applied to the current goal, but it requires the goal to be in a form that matches the lemma\\'s conclusion. Another useful tactic is `squeeze_simp`, which helps in simplifying expressions by suggesting which lemmas to use. It can be particularly helpful when you have a complex goal that needs to be broken down into simpler parts. Recently, a new tactic called `propose` has been introduced. Unlike `library_search`, which works backward from the goal, `propose` works forward from the hypotheses in the context. This can be advantageous in situations where you have a rich set of hypotheses but no clear goal. However, `propose` may not be suitable if there are no hypotheses to work with. If you encounter a specific search problem where existing tools do not seem to help, it is recommended to post an example in the Lean community forums. This can help others identify potential solutions or inspire the development of new search tools. The main issue resolved here is the lack of a direct `Search` equivalent in Lean 4. The source of confusion was the limited functionality of `library_search` and the absence of a comprehensive search tactic. The issue was addressed by exploring alternative tactics like `squeeze_simp` and the newly introduced `propose`, which offer different approaches to finding relevant theorems and definitions.\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"keywords\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\"keyword\\\\\": \\\\\"library_search\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\"rationale\\\\\": \\\\\"This is a primary tactic in Lean 4 for finding lemmas that can close the current goal.

For example, an implication `a \\\\u2192 b` is a function that takes `a` and returns `b`, while `\\\\u00aca` is `a \\\\u2192 false`. Equality `a = b` is an inductive type, and biconditional `a \\\\u2194 b` is a structure. Quantifiers like `forall` are functions, and `exists` is an inductive type.

However, there are several tools and tactics that can help you find relevant theorems or definitions. The primary tools available are `library_search` and `squeeze_simp`. The `library_search` tactic attempts to find a lemma in the library that can close the current goal. While it is useful, it has limitations, particularly when it cannot complete the proof on its own. To use `library_search` effectively, you need to provide it with a statement that closely matches what you are looking for. This tactic works by searching for lemmas that can be applied to the current goal, but it requires the goal to be in a form that matches the lemma\\'s conclusion. Another useful tactic is `squeeze_simp`, which helps in simplifying expressions by suggesting which lemmas to use. It can be particularly helpful when you have a complex goal that needs to be broken down into simpler parts. Recently, a new tactic called `propose` has been introduced. Unlike `library_search`, which works backward from the goal, `propose` works forward from the hypotheses in the context. This can be advantageous in situations where you have a rich set of hypotheses but no clear goal. However, `propose` may not be suitable if there are no hypotheses to work with. If you encounter a specific search problem where existing tools do not seem to help, it is recommended to post an example in the Lean community forums. This can help others identify potential solutions or inspire the development of new search tools. The main issue resolved here is the lack of a direct `Search` equivalent in Lean 4. The source of confusion was the limited functionality of `library_search` and the absence of a comprehensive search tactic.

Quantifiers like `forall` are functions, and `exists` is an inductive type. These concepts are explained in TPIL, but it is important to internalize them to effectively use term mode.

Specifically, how can one handle cases where the goal is not a \\'Prop\\' and involves types like \\'List\\' or \\'Fin\\'? Additionally, what are more elegant ways to handle if-then-else chaining in such scenarios?\",\\n  \"answer\": \"The \\'cases\\' tactic in Lean is primarily used when the goal is a \\'Prop\\', as it relies on the \\'casesOn\\' method associated with inductive types, which is specialized for propositions. When the goal is not a \\'Prop\\', such as when dealing with types like \\'List\\' or \\'Fin\\', the \\'cases\\' tactic may not work due to type mismatches or other restrictions. In these situations, alternative approaches are necessary. For instance, you can use if-then-else chaining to handle different cases based on type equality. Here is an example of how to handle such cases elegantly without using \\'cases\\':\\n\\n```lean\\ndef splitNoCases\\' {α β : Nat} (a : Fin α) (b : Fin β) (γ : Nat) (γ_def : γ ∈ [α, β]) : Fin γ :=\\n  if h : γ = α then\\n    Fin.cast h.symm a\\n  else if h\\' : γ = β then\\n    Fin.cast h\\'.symm b\\n  else\\n    by exfalso; simp at γ_def; tauto\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the \\'if h : γ = α\\' construct is used to check if \\'γ\\' is equal to \\'α\\', and if so, \\'Fin.cast h.symm a\\' is used to cast \\'a\\' to the appropriate type. Similarly, \\'if h\\' : γ = β\\' handles the case where \\'γ\\' is equal to \\'β\\'. If neither condition is met, the \\'exfalso\\' tactic is used to derive a contradiction, leveraging \\'simp\\' and \\'tauto\\' to simplify and resolve the goal.\\n\\nThe main issue resolved here is the limitation of the \\'cases\\' tactic when the goal is not a \\'Prop\\'. The source of confusion was the restriction of \\'cases\\' to propositions and how to handle goals involving other types. The issue was resolved by using if-then-else chaining and type casting with \\'Fin.cast\\', providing a more elegant and functional approach to handle such cases.\")\\n\\t\"keywords\": {\\'cases\\', \\'Prop\\', \\'inductive type\\', \\'type mismatch\\', \\'Fin.cast\\', \\'Fin.cast h.symm\\'}\\n}\\n{\\n  \"question\": In the context of defining a norm for an Octonion algebra over a field, how can one ensure that the norm function correctly utilizes the star operation for each component? The initial attempt to define the norm function using the star operation resulted in a \\'failed to synthesize\\' error. The code snippet provided is as follows:\\n\\n```python\\ndef Octonion.norm {α : Type} [Field α](p: 𝕆[α])  : α :=\\n  p.re* p.re + p.e1*p.e1 + p.e2*p.e2 + p.e3*p.e3 + p.e4*p.e4 + p.e5*p.e5 + p.e6*p.e6 + p.e7*p.e7\\n```\\n\\nThe goal is to modify it to use the star operation, such as `p.re*(star p.re) + ...`. How can one specify that the fields accept the star operation, and what adjustments are necessary to resolve the synthesis error?\",\\n  \"answer\": \\'To define a norm for an Octonion algebra over a field that correctly utilizes the star operation for each component, you need to ensure that the type `α` supports the star operation.

By adding the `[StarRing α]` constraint, you ensure that `α` supports the star operation. Additionally, marking the `Octonion.star` function as `protected` can prevent naming conflicts.

Additionally, what are the considerations for using other editors like vim or emacs for better accessibility?\",\\n  \"answer\":\\'To make Lean more accessible for visually impaired users, particularly those using screen readers, there are several considerations and potential solutions. Firstly, while VS Code has made significant improvements in accessibility, as highlighted in its latest release notes, it may not be the best starting point for blind users. This is because the infoview and other interactive elements in VS Code might still pose challenges for screen reader users. Instead, focusing on editors like vim or emacs, which have better support for screen readers and braille displays, might be more effective. For instance, the brltty library, which supports braille displays, could be a crucial tool in this context. Additionally, ensuring that unicode is properly handled by these tools is essential, as visually impaired users often face difficulties with unicode-math in TeX files. Collaboration with visually impaired users is vital to gather feedback and make practical improvements. Engaging with the community and developers who are willing to invest time in enhancing accessibility features can lead to significant advancements in making Lean more inclusive.\\'),\\n  \"keywords\":  {\\'vim\\', \\'emacs\\', \\'brltty\\', \\'unicode\\', \\'infoview\\'}.\\n}\\n{\\n  \"question\": \\'Given a `ConstInfo` in Lean, how can one determine the module in which it was defined and its source position?

For finding the source position of any name, you can utilize the `Lean.findDeclarationRanges?` function. This function will provide the source position of the declaration associated with the given name. For retrieving the module, the environment maintains a field `const2ModIdx` that maps constants to their respective module indices. You can use this field to find the module index and subsequently the module name. Here is a code sample that demonstrates how to get the module name for a given name using the environment\\'s `getModuleIdxFor?` method and the `header.moduleNames` array: ```lean def getModuleNameFor?

              " 'answer': \"The 'cases' tactic in Lean is designed to work with goals that are propositions (`Prop`). This is because 'cases' relies on the `casesOn` method associated with inductive types, which is specialized for `Prop`. When the goal is not a `Prop`, using 'cases' can lead to type mismatches or other issues. In your examples, you are trying to use 'cases' on goals that are not propositions, which is why it does not work as expected.\\n\\nFor a more elegant solution to your if-then-else chaining, you can use pattern matching or the `Fin.cast` function.

This function works similarly to Python's `'-'.join(a)`, where you can specify a separator and join the elements of the array or list.For slicing a `String` to get a substring, you can use the `Substring` type in Lean. However, instead of using plain integers for indices, you need to use `String.Pos` for the start and end positions. Here is an example of how you can create a substring from the first 7 characters of a string:```leanlet s₂ : Substring := ⟨s, ⟨0⟩, ⟨7⟩⟩```If you find the notation cumbersome, you can define an instance to simplify the creation of `String.Pos` from natural numbers:```leaninstance : OfNat String.Pos x where  ofNat := {    byteIdx := x  }```With this instance, you can write:```leanlet s₂ : Substring := ⟨s, 0, 7⟩```This approach makes the code more readable and easier to work with.

However, I get an `uncaught exception` error when trying this that I don\\'t understand - the minimally viable code I can find to reproduce this is, in `Main.lean`:\\n\\n```\\nabbrev ExceptStack := ExceptT String IO Nat\\n\\ndef argToConfig (n : Nat) : String → ExceptStack\\n  | \"--ok\" => do\\n    IO.println \"valid arg processed\"\\n    .ok <| pure <| n+1\\n  | _ => .error \"invalid arg\"\\n\\ndef buildConfig (xs : List String) : ExceptStack := do\\n  xs.foldlM argToConfig 0\\n\\ndef main (args : List String) : IO Unit := do\\n  match (← buildConfig args) with\\n  | .ok n => IO.println s!\"valid: {n}\"\\n  | .error err => IO.println err\\n```\\n\\nTrying to run it gives me:\\n\\n```\\niwooden@mbp lean-except-bug % lake build\\n[0/2] Building Main\\n[1/2] Compiling Main\\n[2/2] Linking lean-except-bug\\niwooden@mbp lean-except-bug % .lake/build/bin/lean-except-bug\\nvalid: 0\\niwooden@mbp lean-except-bug % .lake/build/bin/lean-except-bug --ok\\nvalid arg processed\\nvalid: 1\\niwooden@mbp lean-except-bug % .lake/build/bin/lean-except-bug --notok\\nuncaught exception: invalid arg\\n```\\n\\nThe idea here is that I have some default object (in chapter 7.1 this would be the `Config`), use something like `List.foldlM` to make changes in that object for valid arguments, with \\'short-circuiting\\' for invalid arguments. Note that if I use `Except String Nat` here instead of `ExceptT String IO Nat` it works, but I\\'d like the `IO` context available so I can do e.g. filesystem checks as part of the validation.\\n\\nI have two questions:\\n\\n1. Why does this typecheck/compile? I would\\'ve hoped to avoid things like uncaught exceptions.\\n2. What should I use instead of `List.foldlM` here? I can, of course, manually write a recursive function to traverse the list in this context, but I was hoping there\\'s something in the standard library that would work.\\n\\nAgain, thanks so much for putting work into Lean and the great accompanying books! I\\'m having a great time, just this one issue has me scratching my head. Thanks!',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Hello! I\\'m glad to hear you\\'re enjoying learning Lean 4. Let\\'s address your questions and the issue you\\'re encountering.\\n\\nThe main issue here is that the `.error` inside your `argToConfig` function is being interpreted as `EStateM.Result.error` instead of `Except.error`. This is causing an `uncaught exception` because the `String` you passed to it is coerced to an `IO.Exception`. Since you didn\\'t use the `tryCatch` implementation of the `IO` monad, it propagated a `userError \"invalid arg\"` out of `main`, and the runtime caught it.\\n\\nTo resolve this, you should use `throw`, which is the generic function provided by the `MonadExcept` instance for `ExceptT`. This will correctly handle the exception within the `ExceptT` monad. Here\\'s how you can modify your code:\\n\\n```lean\\nabbrev ExceptStack := ExceptT String IO Nat\\n\\ndef argToConfig (n : Nat) : String → ExceptStack\\n  | \"--ok\" => do\\n    IO.println \"valid arg processed\"\\n    .ok <| pure <| n+1\\n  | _ => throw \"invalid arg\"\\n\\ndef buildConfig (xs : List String) : ExceptStack := do\\n  xs.foldlM argToConfig 0\\n\\ndef main (args : List String) : IO Unit := do\\n  match (← buildConfig args) with\\n  | .ok n => IO.println s!\"valid: {n}\"\\n  | .error err => IO.println err\\n```\\n\\nBy using `throw`, you ensure that the error is correctly handled within the `ExceptT` monad, avoiding the uncaught exception issue.\\n\\nRegarding your second question, `List.foldlM` is indeed appropriate for this context. It allows you to traverse the list and apply the `argToConfig` function while handling the monadic context properly. There\\'s no need to write a manual recursive function as `foldlM` is designed to handle such cases.\\n\\nIn summary, the confusion arose from the misinterpretation of `.error` as `EStateM.Result.error` instead of `Except.error`. Using `throw` resolves this issue by correctly handling exceptions within the `ExceptT` monad.\\n\\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

The 'partial' marker is used in the definition of 'while', but since your function is not directly recursive, it does not need to be marked as 'partial'.\\n\\nIf you are concerned about ensuring that your function terminates, you should be aware that using constructs like 'while' can indeed lead to non-terminating behavior.

However, this approach often requires a lot of wrapping and unwrapping, which can be cumbersome. An alternative is to define `XorNat` as a type alias for `Nat` using `def XorNat := Nat`. This can simplify your code by reducing the boilerplate.Here is a refined approach to define the group instance:1. Define `Mul` and `One` instances separately before defining the `Group` instance. This helps in managing the operations more cleanly.2. Use the `XorNat` type alias to avoid excessive wrapping and unwrapping.Here is an example implementation:```leandef XorNat := Natinstance : Mul XorNat where  mul x y := x ^^^ yinstance : One XorNat where  one := 0instance : Group XorNat where  mul := (· * ·)  mul_assoc := Nat.xor_assoc  one := 1  one_mul := Nat.zero_xor  mul_one := Nat.xor_zero  inv := id  mul_left_inv := fun x => rfl```In this implementation:- `Mul` and `One` are defined separately to handle the multiplication and identity element.- The `Group` instance is then defined using these instances, which simplifies the process and reduces boilerplate.By following this approach, you avoid the need to constantly wrap and unwrap values, making your code cleaner and easier to manage.The main issue resolved here was the excessive boilerplate due to wrapping and unwrapping in the newtype wrapper approach.

Then there are people who like to use intrinsically typed syntax and others who prefer extrinsic types.

The confusion arose from not knowing how to handle the optional pattern in the macro. The solution involves using `$[$x]?` in the macro, which is a splice that handles optional syntax elements. If `x` is provided, it constructs the syntax inside the brackets; otherwise, it skips it. This concept is similar to list comprehensions in Python, where you iterate over elements to construct a list or handle optional elements.\\n\\nFor more details on splices and their usage, you can refer to the Lean metaprogramming book available at [Lean Metaprogramming Book](http://github.com/arthurpaulino/lean4-metaprogramming-book/).',\n",

This is causing an `uncaught exception` because the `String` you passed to it is coerced to an `IO.Exception`. Since you didn\\'t use the `tryCatch` implementation of the `IO` monad, it propagated a `userError \"invalid arg\"` out of `main`, and the runtime caught it.\\n\\nTo resolve this, you should use `throw`, which is the generic function provided by the `MonadExcept` instance for `ExceptT`. This will correctly handle the exception within the `ExceptT` monad. Here\\'s how you can modify your code:\\n\\n```lean\\nabbrev ExceptStack := ExceptT String IO Nat\\n\\ndef argToConfig (n : Nat) : String → ExceptStack\\n  | \"--ok\" => do\\n    IO.println \"valid arg processed\"\\n    .ok <| pure <| n+1\\n  | _ => throw \"invalid arg\"\\n\\ndef buildConfig (xs : List String) : ExceptStack := do\\n  xs.foldlM argToConfig 0\\n\\ndef main (args : List String) : IO Unit := do\\n  match (← buildConfig args) with\\n  | .ok n => IO.println s!\"valid: {n}\"\\n  | .error err => IO.println err\\n```\\n\\nBy using `throw`, you ensure that the error is correctly handled within the `ExceptT` monad, avoiding the uncaught exception issue.\\n\\nRegarding your second question, `List.foldlM` is indeed appropriate for this context. It allows you to traverse the list and apply the `argToConfig` function while handling the monadic context properly. There\\'s no need to write a manual recursive function as `foldlM` is designed to handle such cases.\\n\\nIn summary, the confusion arose from the misinterpretation of `.error` as `EStateM.Result.error` instead of `Except.error`. Using `throw` resolves this issue by correctly handling exceptions within the `ExceptT` monad.\\n\\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

              "   'answer': \"Hello Dan,\\n\\nThank you for your question. It looks like you're working through an interesting proof involving inequalities in Lean. Let's address your concern about the use of `calc` blocks and the `r = r` lines.\\n\\nIn your example, you have used `calc` blocks to establish intermediate steps in your proof. Specifically, you wrote:\\n\\n```\\ncalc\\n  r = r := by ring\\n  r ≤ 3 + s := by addarith[h1]\\n```\\n\\nand\\n\\n```\\ncalc\\n  r = r := by ring\\n  r ≤ 3 - s := by addarith[h2]\\n```\\n\\nWhile these lines are technically correct, they might feel redundant or unidiomatic. As Kevin Buzzard suggested, you can simplify your proof by directly using the `addarith` tactic without the need for a `calc` block when only one step is required. For example, you can write:\\n\\n```\\nhave h3 : r ≤ 3 + s := by addarith[h1]\\nhave h4 : r ≤ 3 - s := by addarith[h2]\\n```\\n\\nThis approach is more concise and idiomatic in Lean. The `calc` block is particularly useful when you need to chain together multiple steps that require different tactics. If a statement can be proved in one step, you can generally write the tactic directly without the scaffolding of a `calc` block.\\n\\nThis is a common point of confusion for beginners, as noted by Heather Macbeth and others in the conversation. Understanding when to use `calc` blocks versus direct tactics is an important mental leap in learning Lean. Adding a sentence or two in the early chapters of the book to clarify this could indeed save headaches for many learners.\\n\\nIn summary, if a proof step can be resolved with a single tactic, use that tactic directly. Reserve `calc` blocks for chaining together multiple steps. This will make your proofs cleaner and more idiomatic.\\n\\nI hope this helps!

From the proof-reader point of view, this is less nice because I might be interested to know the details of the proof of `a_more_or_less_complex_lemma`, especially if it's complex, and the way it is written doesn't make anything explicit.

From a proof-writer's perspective, using `simp` is efficient, but it can obscure the details of the proof, making it harder for proof-readers to understand and for porting to other systems or versions.To address this concern, you can use the `simp?` tactic instead of `simp`. The `simp?` tactic provides detailed information about which lemmas were used by `simp` to prove the lemma. This can help you understand the steps involved in the proof and make it more explicit.For example:```leanlemma a_more_or_less_complex_lemma: ... := by simp?```This will give you a list of lemmas that `simp` used, which you can then use to construct a more explicit proof manually.Additionally, you can consider using the `conv` tactic or the `calc` block for more readable and human-like proofs. These methods allow you to break down the proof into smaller, more understandable steps.For instance, using `calc`:```leanlemma a_more_or_less_complex_lemma: ... :=calc  ... : by { -- detailed steps here }  ... : by { -- more detailed steps }```Using these approaches, you can create proofs that are both readable and easier to port to other systems or versions of Lean.In summary, the main issue here is the balance between proof efficiency and readability/portability.

              "   'answer': \"In the given Lean example, the confusion arises from understanding what `Eq.trans` applies to and why it is followed by `Eq.symm` instead of an `assumption`. Here's a detailed explanation to clarify this:When you use `apply Eq.trans`, Lean generates three goals:1. `c = ?a`2. `?a = b`3. An intermediate goal involving an unknown number.The `apply Eq.symm` tactic is then used to transform the first goal `c = ?a` into `?a = c`. This transformation is necessary because we have an assumption of the form `a = c`, which can now be used to satisfy the goal.After applying `Eq.symm`, you use `assumption`, and Lean identifies that `?a` should be `a`. This leaves you with the goal `a = b`, which is satisfied by the second `assumption`.To summarize:- `apply Eq.trans` sets up the goals for transitivity.- `apply Eq.symm` adjusts the goal to match the available assumption.- `assumption` then resolves the goals using the given equalities.Additionally, it's helpful to understand that when you write `apply`, it uses backward reasoning. This means you should read the proof from the bottom to the top, as each tactic modifies the goals step by step.For a more readable proof, you can use:```intro a b c hab haccalc  c = a := hac.symm  _ = b := hab```In `mathlib`, this can be written more compactly as `hac.symm.trans hab`.I hope this clarifies your confusion.

This workaround is currently the recommended approach until a permanent fix is implemented in Lean.In summary, the main issue is Lean's difficulty in inferring that a `Ring` is a `Semiring`, which prevents it from inferring a `Module` instance.

When you use `rw countable_sInter_mem Sct`, Lean first elaborates the term `countable_sInter_mem Sct` without any context, which means it cannot yet determine one of the required typeclasses. This results in a subgoal being created. Lean then attempts to match subexpressions in the goal with the term containing metavariables, which sometimes solves the subgoals before they appear. However, in this case, it does not, and Lean loses track of which subgoals should be solved by typeclass inference. Consequently, `apply_instance` is not automatically invoked to close the goal.To resolve this, you can follow Alex J. Best's suggestion:```rw countable_sInter_mem,exact hS,exact Sct,```This approach sidesteps the issue by separating the steps, allowing Lean to correctly infer the typeclasses. Although it might seem unintuitive that providing less information (by leaving out `Sct` initially) leads to successful inference, it works because it allows Lean to handle the typeclass inference in a more manageable way.In summary, the main issue is the order in which Lean processes typeclass inference during the `rw` operation.

              "   'answer': \"The issue you're encountering is due to a bug in docgen4, which is responsible for generating the documentation. The problem arises because docgen4 does not correctly parse LaTeX expressions, leading to incorrect rendering of mathematical expressions and strange italicization. This is a known issue and has been documented in the docgen4 repository (see [docgen4 issue #178](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/issues/178)).The root of the problem is that underscores and other conflicting syntax in LaTeX can confuse most markdown parsers, including the one used by docgen4. The Lean doc preview tool avoids this issue by replacing everything between single or double dollar signs with placeholders, running the markdown through the parser, and then restoring the placeholders in the resulting HTML.For now, if you are working on a mathlib pull request and your formulas render correctly in the Lean doc preview, you can leave the 'broken' formulas as they are. Once docgen4 has been updated to fix this issue, the formulas will render correctly in the documentation, just as they do in the Lean doc preview.Additionally, there are other implementations, such as the one used in Hugo's goldmark extensions, which handle this issue more robustly by using a similar placeholder approach. However, docgen4 currently uses the reference implementation of the commonmark spec, which is not easily extensible.In summary, the issue is due to docgen4's current inability to parse LaTeX correctly. The recommended approach is to wait for a fix in docgen4, as the problem is already known and being addressed. Meanwhile, you can proceed with your pull request, knowing that the documentation will eventually render correctly once the fix is applied.\",\n",

              "   'answer': \"To type different mathematical symbols in a VS Code file for Lean, you can use specific shortcuts. For example, to type the 'for all' symbol (∀), you can type `\\\\forall`. For the 'greater than or equal to' symbol (≥), you can type `\\\\>=`, and it will automatically convert to the correct symbol. However, in Lean's math library (`mathlib`), it is recommended to use `\\\\le` for 'less than or equal to' (≤) instead of `\\\\>=` to avoid doubling the number of inequality lemmas.If you encounter a symbol in existing Lean code and want to know the shortcut, you can hover over the symbol to see its input method. Additionally, you can refer to the list of Unicode characters used in Julia, as many of them work in VS Code for Lean as well. For a comprehensive list of abbreviations, you can check the [abbreviations.json](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/src/abbreviation/abbreviations.json) file in the Lean VS Code extension repository.In summary, the main issue resolved here is how to input mathematical symbols in Lean using VS Code.

Gabriel Ebner pointed out that in Lean 4, the `rcases` syntax conflicts with the built-in pattern matching syntax and doesn't support half of it. For example, using `ext (x, y)` results in a syntax error because it uses `rcases`, whereas `funext (x, y)` works because it uses the normal pattern-matching syntax. In an ideal scenario, the built-in pattern matching would support nested or-patterns, eliminating the need for a separate `rcases`. However, this would be less powerful in some cases, such as when working with `rfl`. Gabriel also mentioned that the built-in `case` tactic doesn't support patterns, and neither does `induction x with | ctor .. =>`. Therefore, adding an `rcase` tactic that accepts `rcases` patterns could be a solution, but it would require careful consideration to avoid ambiguities, especially since Lean patterns are just `term` expressions.Mario Carneiro added that unifying `rcases` patterns with regular Lean patterns is unlikely due to the constraints of `term` expressions. However, making `rcases` patterns subsume term patterns could be a possibility, though it would require careful handling to avoid ambiguities.In summary, while integrating `rcases` syntax into `case _` after `induction` is theoretically possible, it involves significant challenges and potential conflicts with existing syntax. The current recommendation is to use the built-in pattern matching features where possible and consider adding an `rcase` tactic for specific use cases.\",\n",

              "   'answer': \"It seems you are experiencing deterministic timeouts after upgrading mathlib, and the profiler hasn't been helpful. This issue can be particularly tricky to debug. Here’s a step-by-step approach to resolve it:1. **Replicating VSCode Behavior in Command Line**:    - You noticed that the timeout occurs in VSCode but not with `lean --make bug.lean`. This discrepancy is due to different time limits. In VSCode, your 'Lean: Time Limit' is set to 100000. To replicate this in the command line, use the `-T100000` argument:      ```     lean --make bug.lean -T100000     ```   - This should produce the same timeout errors in the command line as in VSCode.2. **Simplifying the Example**:   - You provided a smaller example that still causes a timeout. The issue often lies in the use of non-terminal `simp` calls, which can be very slow, especially with many imports.3. **Optimizing `simp` Calls**:   - Replace non-terminal `simp` calls with `simp only`. This restricts the simplifier to a specific set of lemmas, making it faster.   - Use `squeeze_simp` to get suggestions for `simp only`:     ```     squeeze_simp     ```   - This will provide a list of lemmas that `simp` is using, which you can then replace with `simp only`.4. **Profiling and Debugging**:   - Enable the profiler with `set_option profiler true` at the top of your file. This will show elaboration times in the infoview, helping you identify slow parts.   - Use `sorry` to isolate slow parts of the proof. Replace blocks with `sorry { ... }` to see if elaboration speeds up.5. **Example Fix**:   - Here’s an optimized version of your lemma:     ```     import measure_theory.integral.circle_integral     open complex (abs)     open_locale real     set_option profiler true     -- Given z ≠ 0, we can find a slightly smaller nearby w     lemma slightly_smaller {z : ℂ} (nz : z ≠ 0) {r : ℝ} (rp : 0 < r) : ∃ w, abs (w - z) < r ∧ abs w < abs z :=     begin       by_cases rz : abs z < r, {         use 0,         split,         { simp only [rz, zero_sub, absolute_value.map_neg], },         { simp only [nz, absolute_value.pos_iff, ne.def, not_false_iff, absolute_value.map_zero], },       },       sorry     end     ```   - This change resulted in a significant speedup, reducing elaboration time from 4.13s to 310ms.By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the deterministic timeouts and optimize your Lean code effectively.\",\n",

This makes properties like `IsHomeomorph` less frequently used in comparison. However, this does make it cumbersome to state that a function is a homeomorphism, as the easiest ways currently are `Continuous f ∧ IsOpenMap f ∧ Bijective f` or `∃ h : Homeomorph X Y, h = f`.One potential issue with defining `IsHomeomorph` is that it would require stating each lemma that mentions homeomorphisms twice: once using `Homeomorph` and once using `IsHomeomorph`. Despite this, there is support for adding an `IsHomeomorph` predicate and developing an API to transform between `Homeomorph` and `IsHomeomorph` conveniently. This would align with the unbundling approach used for continuous maps and could make the API for homeomorphisms more robust.In response to this discussion, a pull request has been opened to add the `IsHomeomorph` predicate along with some useful properties and characterizations.

This lemma provides the `MeasurePreserving` property for the measurable equivalence between `(Fin (n+1) → ℝ)` and `(Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ`. Kevin Buzzard suggested using a Haar measure argument, which states that the product measure is translation-invariant and must be a constant multiple of the measure on `ℝ^{n+1}`. This is because the Haar measure is unique up to a constant.Sebastien Gouezel pointed out the specific lemma `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piFinSuccAboveEquiv` in the mathlib documentation, which directly addresses the concern about the `MeasurePreserving` property.

Firstly, defining the regulator is straightforward and can be done using the covolume of the unit lattice in a number field. This has been initiated in Mathlib. The next step involves defining the Dedekind zeta function of a global field and proving its properties, which is more complex, especially for non-abelian fields. Analytic continuation and the functional equation for Dedekind zeta functions are challenging but not strictly necessary for the class number formula, which can be formulated as a one-sided limit.Additionally, we need to compute the limit of the number of principal ideals of norm ≤ n divided by n. This involves defining a cone in ℝ^r₁ × ℂ^r₂ that serves as a fundamental domain for the action of the unit group. The geometry of numbers provides techniques to estimate this limit, but proving the existence of the Riemann integral of the characteristic function of a set is still required. Another significant task is the actual computation of the volume, which involves technical changes of variables.Recent developments, such as the addition of quotient volume techniques in Mathlib, can aid in these computations.

For example, you can import the necessary modules and check for existing instances:```leanimport Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.Basic#synth LinearOrder Unit#synth CommMonoid Unit#synth LinearOrderedCommMonoid Unit```If the required instance is not available, you can define it yourself.

              "   'answer': \"The main issue here is the default value of `SimpleGraph.dist` for disconnected vertices, which is set to zero, while standard references and other parts of the SimpleGraph library use infinity. The source of confusion is the inconsistency in the default value for distance in disconnected graphs.Yaël Dillies explained that the reason for using `ℕ` (natural numbers) instead of `ℕ∞` (natural numbers extended with infinity) is that `ℕ` is generally easier to work with, though this is not a strong reason. Rida Hamadani suggested changing the default to infinity, to which Yaël responded that it might not be unreasonable and encouraged trying it out, but warned about the potential for extensive library housekeeping.Rida's goal was to define eccentricity, radius, and diameter of a simple graph, which led to the examination of the distance function. Yaël suggested that for most applications, it might not matter whether these values are `ℕ`- or `ℕ∞`-valued, and recommended following the existing mathlib conventions.Regarding where to include these definitions, Rida proposed starting in the `Metric.lean` file and moving them to separate files as they develop their own results. Yaël agreed with this approach.Ruben Van de Velde suggested checking for an existing `edist` (extended distance) that defaults to infinity. Rida confirmed there was no such `edist` for SimpleGraph but understood that if issues arise due to the current `dist` default, an `edist` could be defined and used instead. Ruben confirmed this pattern exists in other parts of mathlib.In summary, the issue of default distance for disconnected vertices can be addressed by either following the current convention or defining an `edist` if necessary. The approach to adding new definitions should be incremental, starting in `Metric.lean` and moving to separate files as needed.\",\n",

Right now, we can do this only for particular values of `R`, but we have no type class assumptions that we can put on `R` (at least, no existing ones, and any new one would be ad-hoc) to guarantee that `C(α, R)` is a star-ordered ring.

Let's address the issues you raised regarding the `StarOrderedRing` and its potential reformation into a mixin class that takes `StarRing` as a parameter.\\n\\n### Main Issue\\nThe main issue is the need to make `C(α, R)` into a star-ordered ring for certain values of `R`. Currently, there are no type class assumptions that can be put on `R` to guarantee that `C(α, R)` is a star-ordered ring. This limitation is problematic for working with the functional calculus, as you want to ensure that `cfcHom` is monotone on functions, which follows from it being a star homomorphism, but only if the domain and codomain are star-ordered rings.\\n\\n### Source of Confusion\\nThe confusion arises from the current inability to assume any hypothesis on `R` to make the continuous `R`-valued functions a star-ordered ring. Additionally, assuming `[StarOrderedRing C(α, R)]` directly is not feasible because it would introduce a second star operation on the continuous functions.\\n\\n### Resolution\\nTo resolve this, you propose making `StarOrderedRing` a mixin class that takes `StarRing` as a parameter. This approach would allow for more flexible type class assumptions and avoid the issue of introducing a second star operation. By doing so, you can ensure that `cfcHom` is order-preserving when the domain and codomain are star-ordered rings. This change also aligns with the eventual goal of making `C(α, A)` a star-ordered ring whenever `A` is a C⋆-algebra, without needing to assume this as a hypothesis.\\n\\n### Community Feedback\\n- Frédéric Dupuis supports the change.- Eric Wieser finds it harmless but seeks clarification on the motivation.- Anatole Dedecker agrees, noting that it makes sense to use compatibility mixins instead of bundling algebra and order.In summary, the proposed change to make `StarOrderedRing` a mixin class addresses the need for flexible type class assumptions and avoids the complications of multiple star operations, thereby facilitating the functional calculus and future extensions involving C⋆-algebras.Best regards,[Your Name]\",\n",

The issue you're encountering is related to the `lakefile.olean` file, which is a performance optimization that caches the elaboration of the `lakefile.lean`. This can cause problems when you need to switch between different configurations based on an environment variable, as the cached file does not get updated automatically. \\n\\nA cleaner alternative to manually deleting the `lakefile.olean` file and running `lake update` is to use the `-R` flag with the `lake update` command, i.e., `lake update -R`. The `-R` flag stands for `--reconfigure` and forces Lake to re-elaborate the `lakefile.lean`, ensuring that your changes are taken into account. \\n\\nRegarding whether `lake update` and `lake clean` should always delete and recreate the `lakefile.olean`, it is a matter of balancing performance and consistency. While re-elaborating the file by default could ensure consistent results, it might not be necessary for all users and could impact performance. The current approach is to do the faster operation by default and allow users to request the slower, more thorough operation when needed using the `-R` flag. \\n\\nAdditionally, you mentioned using an environment variable to switch between a local copy of a dependency or downloading it. A more intended way to handle such configurations is to use the `-K` option, which allows you to pass configuration options to Lake. You can then check for these options within your `lakefile.lean` using `if get_config? my.config.option |>.isSome then _ else _`. This approach still requires the `-R` flag to have any effect. \\n\\nI hope this helps resolve your issue. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!\",\n",

Chris Hughes suggested a potential approach involving embedding `(C ⥤ Type)` into `Type 1` by sending `F` to `Hom (Terminal Object) F` and then composing this with Yoneda. However, Tanner Swett highlighted a critical issue: there exists a category with exactly one object and two endomorphisms, which would imply the existence of a type `a` with exactly two functions `a -> a`. This contradicts ordinary set theory, which asserts that no such type exists.Floris van Doorn provided a proof in Lean, using choice, to show that there is no type `α` such that `#(α → α) = 2`. Chris Hughes further demonstrated that choice is not necessary for this proof, as only `Quot.sound` is used, indicating that a very weak type theory would be required for the axiom to be consistent.Trebor Huang added that Lean implicitly assumes axiom K, and in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), the delooping of Z/2Z has exactly two endomorphisms, but the type of endomorphisms is not isomorphic to `Bool`, just has cardinality 2. Despite this, it is still impossible to achieve the other two-morphism-single-object category due to the constant map on inhabited objects.In summary, the main issue is that the proposed axiom leads to a contradiction with established set theory principles, specifically regarding the existence of a type with exactly two endomorphisms.

This approach is used to avoid the issues that arise from too much API leakage, which can make the abstraction less effective.However, whether to use a structure or an `irreducible` type synonym depends on the specific situation and the desired level of abstraction control. For example, recent changes in the mathlib library have seen the removal of `irreducible` from certain type synonyms like `mul_opposite` and `add_opposite`, while others like `opposite` in category theory remain `irreducible`.In summary, the use of a structure with one field in `category_theory.quotient` is a deliberate design choice to enforce controlled transitions and prevent API leakage, similar to the approach in `category_theory.discrete`.',\n",

By using `Exists.choose`, you can bypass this limitation and successfully define the `sup` function.In mathlib3, the `sup` function is defined for all subsets of ℝ and returns default values for subsets that do not have a supremum.

However, there is a discussion about a potential tactic called `by_approx` that could handle such cases more generally without needing explicit bounds.Kevin Buzzard mentioned that this might be the not-yet-existing `by_approx` tactic, which has been discussed occasionally. Yaël Dillies suggested searching for `approx` on Zulip for more information. Mauricio Collares provided a link to a pull request [#8949](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8949) where `by_approx` is being developed.In summary, the main issue is finding a tactic that can solve inequalities involving π without explicit bounds. The confusion arises from the need for such a tactic, which is currently under development as `by_approx`. You can follow the progress of this tactic in the provided pull request link.To resolve your issue, you can either continue using known bounds and tactics like `linarith` or keep an eye on the development of `by_approx` for a more general solution in the future.',\n",

              "   'answer': \"To define an operator like division whose output is `option` and unify it with the `has_div` class, you have two main approaches. First, if you want to avoid using an `option` or a junk value, you can use `classical.epsilon` to define the division function. Here is an example:```leandef rat.div2 : ℚ → ℚ → ℚ :=classical.epsilon $ λ f, ∀ a b, b ≠ 0 → f a b = a * b⁻¹```This approach avoids the need for an `option` type by using the `classical.epsilon` function to select a value that satisfies the given condition.However, if you prefer to keep the `option` type and use your original definition, you will need to handle the case where the denominator is zero. In this case, you can use `option.get_or_else` to provide a default value when the denominator is zero. Here is a link to the relevant documentation: [docs#option.get_or_else](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/option.get_or_else).Regarding your dimensional analysis project, if you are using `classical.epsilon`, you need to ensure that there exists at least one function that satisfies the epsilon condition. Here is an example of how to prove that such a function exists:```leanexample {α} (a : dimension α) [decidable_eq (dimension α)] : a.add a = a :=begin  generalize hb : a = b, symmetry' at hb,  nth_rewrite 1 hb, revert b a hb, unfold dimension.add,  apply classical.epsilon_spec (⟨λ a _, a, λ _ _ _, rfl⟩ :    ∃ (f : dimension α → dimension α → dimension α), ∀ a b, a = b → f a b = a),end```In this example, we use `classical.epsilon_spec` to prove that there exists a function `f` such that `f a b = a` when `a = b`. This ensures that the epsilon condition is satisfied.In summary, the main issue was how to define a division operator that returns an `option` type and unify it with the `has_div` class. The confusion arose from how to handle the case where the denominator is zero and how to use `classical.epsilon` effectively. The issue was resolved by either using `classical.epsilon` to avoid the `option` type or using `option.get_or_else` to handle the zero denominator case. Additionally, an example was provided to show how to prove the existence of a function that satisfies the epsilon condition in the context of dimensional analysis.\",\n",

Parentheses `( )` are used purely for grouping, while `⟨ ⟩` are used for destructuring.In your example, `rintro x ⟨hs | ht⟩` does not work because `⟨ ⟩` is already destructing the union, and then `hs | ht` is trying to destruct `s`, which doesn't work. The correct syntax is `rintro x (hs | ht)`, which groups the pattern `hs | ht` correctly.The full syntax for destructing a multi-constructor inductive type in `rcases` is `⟨a1, a2, .., an⟩ | ⟨b1, b2, .., bn⟩ | .. | ⟨z1, z2, .., zn⟩`. In cases where there is only one argument to a given constructor, you can omit the outer `⟨⟩`.In `rintro`, parentheses are required if you want to do any pattern matching because there is otherwise no separator between the arguments to `intro` themselves. Parentheses have no pattern-matching effect; they are just for grouping.To summarize, in your example, the correct syntax is `rintro x (hs | ht)`, or its desugared form `rintro x (⟨hs⟩ | ⟨ht⟩)`. If you don't specify enough constructors, the others are treated as `_`, so `rintro x ⟨hs⟩` is desugared to the same as `rintro x (⟨hs⟩ | ⟨_⟩)`. This is why `hs` here is already a proof of `s`, and if you write `hs | ht` for the pattern, you are pattern matching something of variable type, which is an error.To make it clearer, you can use the following approach:```example : s ∩ t ∪ s ∩ u ⊆ s ∩ (t ∪ u) := by  intro x h  rcases h with hs | ht```Here, `hs | ht` is splitting the `∪`, which is an `∨`.

              "   'answer': \"To address the issue of Lean displaying `blah.F1` instead of `X.F1` or `Y.F1` when `blah` is made into a type-class, you can use the `[]` trick in the structure declaration. Specifically, you should replace `(the_field_I_want_a_projection_of : its_type)` with `(the_field_I_want_a_projection_of [] : its_type)`. This will help Lean to display the projections in a more useful way.For example, consider the following structure definition for a functor:```leanclass functor (𝓒 : Type u₁) [category_str.{v₁} 𝓒] (𝓓 : Type u₂) [category_str.{v₂} 𝓓] : Type (max v₁ v₂ u₁ u₂) :=(obj [] : 𝓒 → 𝓓)(mor [] : Π {X Y : 𝓒}, (X ⟶ Y) → (obj X ⟶ obj Y))(resp_id'   : ∀ (X : 𝓒), mor (𝟙 X) = 𝟙 (obj X))(resp_comp' : ∀ {X Y Z : 𝓒} (f : X ⟶ Y) (g : Y ⟶ Z), mor (f ≫ g) = (mor f) ≫ (mor g))```When defining the composition of functors, you might encounter Lean displaying `mor 𝓔 (mor 𝓓 (𝟙 X)) = 𝟙 (obj (obj X))` instead of the more readable `G.mor (F.mor (𝟙 X)) = 𝟙 (G.obj (F.obj X))`. By adding `[]` to the `obj` and `mor` fields, Lean will display the projections in a more readable way.However, it is important to note that making `functor` a type-class is generally not recommended because it restricts you to using only one functor between any two categories. Instead, you can define your structure as a regular structure and then add `attribute [class]` to it if needed.In summary, the `[]` trick helps with displaying projections in a more readable way, but you should be cautious about making certain structures into type-classes due to potential limitations. Additionally, pretty-printing (pp) settings in Lean can also influence how projections are displayed, but the `[]` trick is a more direct solution for this specific issue.\",\n",

The issue you're encountering with your PR [#13533](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13533) failing the CI 'Post PR summary comment / build (pull_request)' is due to the script trying to retrieve a file that doesn't exist in the current commit. The error message indicates that the script `./scripts/update_PR_comment.sh` is missing, leading to the process failing with exit code 127. \\n\\nRuben Van de Velde suggested merging the master branch into your branch, which resolved the issue. This solution works because a small number of PRs were caught in a state where the script was looking for a file in a commit of master that was too early to contain it. By updating your branch with the latest changes from master, the required file becomes available, and the script can execute successfully.\\n\\nFor James Sundstrom, who faced a similar issue with PR [#13013](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13013) and ended up with a PR showing changes to 2,215 files, the problem was likely due to an accidental rebase. To resolve this, Jon Eugster suggested using `git cherry-pick` to create a new branch with only the relevant commits. If `git cherry-pick` misses some changes, manually copying the relevant code to a new branch and creating a new PR is a safer option. This approach avoids the risk of unrecoverable loss associated with force-pushing to the old branch.\\n\\nIn summary, merging the master branch can resolve issues with missing files in CI scripts, and creating a new branch with the correct commits can fix problems caused by accidental rebases.\",\n",

This is why the CI flagged the issue.To resolve this, you can remove the imports `Mathlib.Algebra.Parity` and `Mathlib.Init.CCLemmas` if they are not essential for your changes. For the theorem `Even_iff_even_val (u : Fin 2) : Even u ↔ Even u.val := sorry`, which requires `Data.Nat.Parity`, you should move it to a more appropriate file, such as `Data.Fin.Parity`.Additionally, it was noted that Yury G.

This can be confusing when constructing mathematical objects like bundled homomorphisms from coercion maps, as you need to refer to the specific `coe` function used in the definition. Moritz Doll suggests that instead of referring to `coe`, you should refer to the map used for the coercion. With the introduction of `FunLike`, this has become more complex, and if you have a `FunLike` instance, you need to refer to `FunLike.coe`. For theorems that refer to `↑` generally, irrespective of implementation, you might need to explicitly call `Coe.coe`. However, this might be due to a bad class design in Lean 4. In cases like embedding a subspace into a full space, the coercion should automatically be replaced by the inclusion map, and the correct lemma should already exist in another class.Gabriel Ebner and others suggest that the current approach to coercions in Lean 4 might need to be reverted, as it complicates the porting process. They recommend searching for discussions on Zulip for more details and potential solutions.In summary, the issue arises from the more detailed handling of coercions in Lean 4, which can be confusing and cumbersome.

Mario Carneiro pointed out that support for such congruence was never robust and didn't function effectively in Lean 3 either. Therefore, the recommended solution is to comment out the `@[congr]` attribute with a porting note, as it doesn't contribute to the functionality in Lean 4.Additionally, James Gallicchio discovered that the translation issue with `perm_inv_core` was due to differences in how implicit parameters are handled between Lean 3 and Lean 4. In Lean 3, implicit parameters are included in the motive when refining with an elaborator, whereas in Lean 4, the implicits are introduced before generating the motive.

This means you should create a corresponding file in mathlib4 with the necessary `#align` statements.In summary, you should port the `Dlist.lean` file to mathlib4, ensuring it includes the appropriate `#align` statements and follows the same file hierarchy as in lean3/mathlib.

He mentioned that while the ultimate mathlib-style definition is not yet in mathlib, you can use the following definition for C^1 paths and holomorphic functions:```leanimport Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.CauchyIntegral/-- Contour integral of `f : ℂ → ℂ` along a path `γ : [a,b] → ℂ`. -/noncomputable def contourIntegral (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) : ℂ :=  ∫ t in a..b, deriv γ t • f (γ t)```This definition should work for your needs if your paths are piecewise C^1 and your function is holomorphic.

Simplifications might be possible, especially if you switch to superharmonic functions to ENNReal, which aligns with the measure theory you need (e.g., Fatou's lemma) and handles the singularity in `-log |f z|`.Antoine Chambert-Loir suggested that in complex analysis, plurisubharmonic (psh) functions are commonly used, which are essentially subharmonic functions in higher dimensions.

The source of confusion was the nature of the recursive definition and termination.

              "   'answer': \"The main issue here is that Lean is unhappy about the positivity of the `interpTerm` function. This is because the function is marked as `partial`, which can cause issues with the Lean compiler, especially when dealing with recursive functions like `Nat.rec`. The confusion arises from the fact that `partial` functions cannot be marked as `noncomputable`, which is necessary for the compiler to handle certain recursive functions.To resolve this issue, you can take the following steps:1. **Remove the `partial` keyword**: The `interpTerm` function is actually structurally recursive, so it doesn't need to be marked as `partial`.2. **Add `noncomputable`**: Since the Lean compiler has trouble with `Nat.rec`, you should mark the function as `noncomputable`.3. **Define a custom recursive function**: Instead of using `Nat.rec`, you can define your own recursive function, `recNat`, which will be structurally recursive and avoid the issues with `Nat.rec`.Here is the modified code:```leandef recNat : τ → (Nat → τ → τ) → Nat → τ  | x, _, Nat.zero => x  | x, f, Nat.succ n => f n (recNat x f n)def interpType : GType → Type  | GNat => Nat  | Arrow τ σ => interpType τ → interpType σdef interpTerm : GTerm A → interpType A  | App τ σ => interpTerm τ (interpTerm σ)  | Zero => Nat.zero  | Succ => Nat.succ  | Rec => recNat  | K => fun x _ => x  | S => fun x y z => x z (y z)```By using `recNat` and removing `partial`, the function will work correctly. Additionally, marking the function as `noncomputable` will help the compiler handle it properly. This approach ensures that the function is structurally recursive and avoids the issues with `Nat.rec`.If you prefer to use `Nat.rec`, you can import `Mathlib.Util.CompileInductive` to make it work, but using your own function definitions like `recNat` is a cleaner solution, especially if you plan to use a similar semantic encoding for other purposes.Finally, here is a theorem and some additional functions to demonstrate the solution:```leantheorem convertible_gives_meta_equality : Convertible a b → interpTerm a = interpTerm b  | ConvApp c1 c2 => by    have h1 := convertible_gives_meta_equality c1    have h2 := convertible_gives_meta_equality c2    simp [interpTerm]    rw [h1, h2]  | ConvK => rfl  | ConvS => rfl  | ConvZero => rfl  | ConvSucc => rfldef glueType : GType → Type  | GNat => Nat  | Arrow τ σ => GTerm (Arrow τ σ) × (glueType τ → glueType σ)def reifyNat : Nat → GTerm GNat  | Nat.zero => Zero  | Nat.succ n => App Succ (reifyNat n)def reify : ∀ {τ}, glueType τ → GTerm τ  | GNat, n => reifyNat n  | Arrow _ _, (t, _) => tdef appsem : glueType (Arrow τ σ) → glueType τ → glueType σ  | (_, f), u => f udef glueTerm : GTerm τ → glueType τ  | K       => (K, fun p => ⟨App K (reify p), fun _ => p⟩)  | S       => (S, fun p => ⟨App S (reify p), fun q => ⟨ App (App S (reify p)) (reify q), fun r => appsem (appsem p r) (appsem q r)⟩⟩)  | App t u => appsem (glueTerm t) (glueTerm u)  | Zero    => Nat.zero  | Succ    => (Succ, Nat.succ)  | Rec     => (Rec, fun p => ⟨App Rec (reify p), fun q => ⟨App (App Rec (reify p)) (reify q), recNat p (fun n r => appsem (appsem q n) r)⟩⟩)def normalize : GTerm τ → GTerm τ := reify ∘ glueTermdef test : GTerm GNat := App (App K (App Succ Zero)) Zero#eval test#eval normalize test```This solution should resolve the issues you were facing and allow your code to work correctly.\",\n",

This pattern allows the `match` expression to return functions over the free variables whose types we want to refine. In your example:```import data.nat.primeexample (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=match n.min_fac, rfl : ∀ x, n.min_fac = x → ℕ with  | 0, h := absurd h n.min_fac_pos.ne'  | (n+1), h := n  end```The `match` expression is used to create a dependent function `∀ x, n.min_fac = x → ℕ`. This means that the `match` is not just matching on `n.min_fac` but also on the proof that `n.min_fac = x`. The right-hand side (RHS) of the `match` provides values to this dependent function.To clarify, the trailing `ℕ` in the `match` expression is the return type of the `match`, not an input. If you don't specify the type of a `match`, its type will be your goal. In this case, the goal is to return a natural number (`ℕ`).If you want to avoid writing the expected type of the `match` expression explicitly, you can use an underscore `_`:```example (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=match n.min_fac, rfl : ∀ x, n.min_fac = x → _ with  | 0, h := absurd h n.min_fac_pos.ne'  | (n+1), h := n  end```This will still work and achieve the same result. The `match` expression creates a dependent function that takes `x` and a proof that `n.min_fac = x` and returns a natural number.You can verify this by defining a function and printing its internal representation:```def foo (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=match n.min_fac, rfl : ∀ x, n.min_fac = x → _ with  | 0, h := absurd h n.min_fac_pos.ne'  | (n+1), h := n  end#print foo/-def foo : ℕ → ℕ :=λ (n : ℕ), foo._match_1 n n.min_fac _-/#print foo._match_1/-def foo._match_1 : Π (n x : ℕ), n.min_fac = x → ℕ :=...-/```This shows that the `match` function has extra arguments corresponding to values it depends on (`n` in this case).

Specifically, you're seeing errors for `has_lt M.state`, `has_zero M.state`, and `has_one M.ι`, even though `M.state` and `M.ι` are both `nat`. This issue arises because Lean does not eagerly unfold definitions, which means it doesn't automatically recognize that `M.state` and `M.ι` are `nat`.To resolve this, you can manually add the necessary instances for `M.state` and `M.ι` as follows:```leaninstance : semiring M.ι :=nat.semiringinstance : semiring M.state :=nat.semiringinstance : has_lt M.state :=nat.has_lttheorem silly :  (M.tr (M.init, 1)).1 > 0 := sorry```Alternatively, you can change the definition of `M` from `def` to `abbreviation`, which makes the definition reducible and allows typeclass resolution to see through it:```leanabbreviation M : mealy := mealy.mk ℕ ℕ ℕ (λ p, let σ := p.1 in                                               let i := p.2 in                                               (p.1+p.2, p.1+p.2)) 0```Another approach is to make `state`, `ι`, and `ω` parameters in the definition of `mealy`. This way, you won't have to write these instances every time, and it avoids some potential issues with `reducible` seeing through too much:```leanstructure mealy (state ι ω : Type) :=mk :: (tr : state × ι -> state × ω)      (init : state)-- an example mealy machinedef M : mealy ℕ ℕ ℕ := mealy.mk (λ p, let σ := p.1 in                                       let i := p.2 in                                       (p.1+p.2, p.1+p.2)) 0```This should resolve the instance resolution failures and make your theorem work as expected.The main issue here was that Lean's typeclass resolution couldn't automatically infer the necessary instances for `M.state` and `M.ι` because it doesn't unfold definitions eagerly. By either manually adding the instances, making the definition reducible, or parameterizing the types in the structure, you can resolve this issue.I hope this helps!

The source of confusion was whether induction could be used over types, but the resolution lies in using cardinality arguments. If two types do not have the same cardinality, they are not equal. If they do have the same cardinality, it is generally undecidable whether they are equal or not within Lean's type theory.Additionally, it was discussed that in Lean, equality of types is often neither provable nor disprovable due to the axioms of type theory not specifying the underlying construction of types. This means that the equality of types can depend on the model of type theory being used.In summary, the key to proving type inequality in Lean is to use properties like cardinality rather than attempting induction over types.\",\n",

I find `String` doesn't have an instance of `GetElem` which makes getting a character from a string a bit inconvenient. Instead, it has a unique component `Iterator` compared to `List` and `Array`, although `Iterator` doesn't have the API like `def curr' (it: Iterator) (h: ¬it.atEnd): Char` and `def next' (it: Iterator) (h: ¬it.atEnd): Iterator`. So I have some questions: 1. Is it intentionally designed that `String` doesn't support `GetElem`? If no, then here is a feature request for it. 2. Is it possible for other data structures (`List`, `Array`, etc.) to support `Iterator`? 3. Another request for `String.Iterator.curr'` and `String.Iterator.next'` described above.\",\n",
              "   'answer': 'Hello! Thank you for your questions. Let\\'s address them one by one.1. **Intentional Design of `String` without `GetElem`**:   Yes, it is intentional that `String` does not support `GetElem`. The primary reason is that strings in Lean are indexed by `String.Pos` rather than `Nat`, and not all possible values of `String.Pos` are valid for a given string. For example, indexing a string with an invalid `String.Pos` can lead to unexpected results or errors. Here are some examples to illustrate this:   ```lean   #eval \"abc\".get {byteIdx:=0} -- \\'a\\'   #eval \"abc\".get {byteIdx:=1} -- \\'b\\'   #eval \"abc\".get {byteIdx:=2} -- \\'c\\'   #eval \"▸bc\".get {byteIdx:=0} -- \\'▸\\'   #eval \"▸bc\".get {byteIdx:=1} -- \\'A\\' -- not a valid character position   #eval \"▸bc\".get {byteIdx:=2} -- \\'A\\' -- not a valid character position   #eval \"▸bc\".get {byteIdx:=3} -- \\'b\\'   #eval \"▸bc\".get {byteIdx:=4} -- \\'c\\'   ```   Defining a version of `GetElem` for `String` that uses `Nat` would make `str[n]` an `O(n)` operation instead of `O(1)`, which is not ideal.2. **Support for `Iterator` in Other Data Structures**:   It is possible for other data structures like `List` and `Array` to support `Iterator`. However, the design choice in Lean is to use `Iterator` specifically for `String` to handle the unique indexing requirements and to provide efficient character access.3. **Requests for `String.Iterator.curr\\'` and `String.Iterator.next\\'`**:   The `Substring` type in Lean provides better support than `Iterator` for many use cases. If you need to iterate over a string, consider using `Substring` and `Stream`. These abstractions are designed to handle string operations more efficiently and safely. For example, you can use `Substring` to iterate over characters in a string without worrying about invalid positions.   ```lean   for c in substr do     -- process character c   ```   If you still need to implement custom string algorithms, you can convert the string to a list of characters and work with that list. This approach avoids the complexities and potential pitfalls of direct string indexing.In summary, the design choices in Lean regarding `String` and `GetElem` are made to ensure safety and efficiency. Using `Substring` and `Stream` is recommended for most string operations. If you need to implement specific algorithms, consider converting the string to a list of characters.I hope this helps!

              "   'answer': 'An instance in Lean 4 is a specific implementation of a type class. Type classes in Lean are similar to traits in Rust or interfaces in Java. Technically, type classes are structures, and an instance is a definition that provides a value for such a structure, with a special tag that makes it recognizable to the compiler.The main difference between an instance and a regular definition (`def`) is that an instance is registered for class searching by the Lean compiler. This means that when Lean tries to resolve an instance parameter, it searches through all declarations marked as instances. This is done using the `@[instance]` attribute, which can be automatically assigned using the `instance` keyword or manually by writing `attribute [instance] your_def`.For `class inductive` types, the syntax for creating an instance is the same as for a regular `def`, but the instance must be marked with the `@[instance]` attribute to be properly registered for searching. This ensures that Lean can find and use the instance when needed.In summary, the confusion often arises from the behind-the-scenes workings of Lean, where type classes and instances are translated into core concepts. The key takeaway is that an instance is essentially a `def` with an additional attribute that makes it searchable by the compiler, ensuring it functions correctly within the type class system.',\n",

Subtraction `a - b` on natural numbers is defined as zero if `b > a`, so your claim is false in the context of natural numbers. To resolve this, you should use integers instead of natural numbers. The `ring` tactic works better with integers when subtraction is involved. Here is how you can reformulate your theorem using integers:```leanimport Mathlibtheorem H {i j k : ℤ} : i * j = i * (j - k) + k * i := by  ring```Additionally, `norm_num` is used for calculations with explicit numbers, such as normalizing expressions involving concrete numerical values. For example:```leanexample : 4 + 1 = 1 + 2 * 2 := by  norm_num```If you have an arithmetic expression of naturals with a subexpression `(j - k)` and an assumption `H : k <= j`, you can use the `zify` tactic to convert the goal into an integer context where `ring` can be applied effectively.

              "   'answer': 'The choice of using the least positive residue in modular arithmetic is primarily for convenience and consistency. In number theory, having a remainder that is always within a specific range (0 to r-1) provides a natural and well-behaved mapping from the integers to the ring Z/rZ. This consistency simplifies many mathematical operations and proofs. While it is true that an alternative system could also produce a well-defined range, having a single, universally accepted convention is more practical. This is especially important in computer science, where predictable and efficient behavior is crucial for algorithm design and implementation. The least positive residue ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which aligns with the behavior of many programming languages and their modulo operations.The confusion often arises from different conventions used in various contexts, such as the behavior of the modulo operation in the C programming language, which can produce negative remainders. This can lead to errors, such as incorrectly checking if a number is odd using `n % 2 == 1`, which fails for negative numbers.In summary, the least positive residue is chosen for its mathematical convenience and practical utility in computing, providing a consistent and predictable framework for modular arithmetic.',\n",

              "   'answer': \"Hello Chris,\\n\\nIt looks like you're having trouble with importing the correct modules and using the `sqrt` function in Lean. Let's break down the issues and how to resolve them.\\n\\n1. **Importing Modules**: The first import you have, `import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Modeq`, works, but you mentioned that uncommenting the second import, `import Mathlib.Data.Real.Sqrt`, causes issues. This might be due to case sensitivity in the module names. Ensure that the capitalization matches exactly with the filenames in the Mathlib documentation. For example, `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Modeq` should be correct, but double-check the exact path for the real square root module.\\n\\n2. **Using `sqrt`**: There are two different `sqrt` functions in Lean: `Nat.sqrt` and `Real.sqrt`. The `Nat.sqrt` function computes the integer square root, which is why `sqrt 5` evaluates to `2`. On the other hand, `Real.sqrt` is used for real numbers and is more appropriate for mathematical proofs.\\n\\n   - To use `Nat.sqrt`, you can `open Nat` in your code. However, this is not what you want for real number calculations.   - To use `Real.sqrt`, you should `open Real`. However, note that `Real.sqrt` cannot be evaluated directly using `#eval` because it is intended for proofs rather than computation.\\n\\n3. **Error Message**: The error `IR check failed at '_eval', error: unknown declaration 'Real.sqrt'` indicates that `Real.sqrt` cannot be computed directly. This is expected behavior because `Real.sqrt` is not a computable function in Lean.\\n\\n4. **Correcting Your Code**: Based on your requirements, you should use `Real.sqrt` for the `alph_reduced` structure. Also, you mentioned that you accidentally used `%` instead of `/` for the real number operations. Here is the corrected version of your code:\\n\\n```lean\\nimport Mathlib.Data.Nat.Modeq\\nimport Mathlib.Data.Real.Sqrt\\n\\nstructure alph where\\n  d : ℕ\\n  u : ℤ\\n  v : ℕ\\n  v_nezero : 0 < v\\n  u2dmodv : (u*u) % v = d % v\\n\\nstructure alph_reduced where\\n  d : ℕ\\n  u : ℤ\\n  v : ℕ\\n  v_nezero : 0 < v\\n  u2dmodv : (u*u) % v = d % v\\n  gt_one : 1 < (Real.sqrt 2 + u) / v\\n  konj_betw_one_zero : -1 < (- Real.sqrt d + u) / v ∧ (- Real.sqrt d + u) / v < 0\\n```\\n\\nBy importing `Mathlib.Data.Real.Sqrt` and using `Real.sqrt` with the correct division operator `/`, your code should work as intended.\\n\\n**Capitalization in Imports**: Follow the exact capitalization as in the filenames of the Mathlib documentation. This ensures that Lean can correctly locate and import the necessary modules.\\n\\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\",\n",

              "   'answer': \"The issue you're encountering with `nlinarith` stems from its handling of nonlinear arithmetic, which is not complete and can sometimes be unpredictable. The algorithm used by `nlinarith` preprocesses the problem by adding assumptions for every subterm of the form `a^2` or `a*a` in the hypothesis or goal, asserting that these are non-negative. Additionally, it combines pairs of hypotheses to derive new assumptions.In your specific examples, `nlinarith` succeeds for `2*x^2 - 6*x + 9 ≥ 0` because it can derive a contradiction from the assumptions it generates. However, it fails for `x^2 - 6*x + 9 ≥ 0` because the preprocessing steps do not lead to a contradiction that `nlinarith` can detect.To understand why `nlinarith` succeeds or fails in specific cases, you can use the option `set_option trace.linarith true` to generate detailed explanations of the steps `nlinarith` takes. This option is mentioned in the docstring and can help you see the exact assumptions and contradictions `nlinarith` is working with.In summary, the main issue is the incomplete nature of `nlinarith` for nonlinear arithmetic and the specific preprocessing steps it takes. By using the trace option, you can gain insights into why `nlinarith` behaves differently in seemingly similar cases.\",\n",

While the `contradiction` tactic is useful, it doesn't allow you to pass terms that aren't in the proof context. Kyle Miller suggested that if you want to avoid worrying about the order of arguments in `exact absurd h1 h2`, you could use `exact (h1 h2).elim`, although it doesn't save any characters. Another suggestion by Kevin Buzzard is to use `cases h1 h2`, which is shorter. Additionally, Kyle Miller proposed a compositional approach: you can write `have := h1, contradiction` to add `h1` to the local context and then use `contradiction`. This method helps avoid confusion about the order of arguments and keeps the proof succinct.In summary, while there isn't a built-in tactic that directly replaces `exact absurd h1 h2` with a shorter form, using `cases h1 h2` or the compositional approach with `have := h1, contradiction` can help simplify your proofs.\",\n",

Discussions are ongoing, but we are still quite far from having a comprehensive implementation of knot theory in Lean. Regarding the definition of grids in Lean4 or Lean3, it appears that there isn't a canonical definition available at this time. Scott Morrison mentioned that knot theory doesn't necessarily need a particularly careful design ahead of time because there are many ways to represent knots. Eventually, we would want all these representations, and none need to be especially privileged. For example, defining the Alexander polynomial in terms of grid diagrams or the Jones polynomial in terms of planar diagrams would be wonderful even in isolation. Later, theorems connecting these representations and connecting them to actual knots and Reidemeister moves will be developed.Scott also shared his experience with defining the Jones polynomial, noting the challenges with dependently typed definitions, which can make things not work smoothly.

For example, Fermat's Last Theorem is defined using `def` rather than a specialized `conjecture` command. While custom syntax for conjectures could be beneficial, especially if there are many such conjectures, it is not currently implemented.One suggestion to address this is to use classes for assumptions. For instance, if you want to assume the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for a number field `K`, you could write:```leanlemma fancy_thing (K : Type*) [NumberField K] [HasGRH K] : ...```This approach leverages existing Lean features to handle assumptions in a structured way.Another point raised is that the name `flt` should ideally be reserved for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and the conjecture should be named something like `flt.prop`. This naming convention helps distinguish between the conjecture and its proof.In summary, while the `conjecture` command does not exist, you can use `def` for conjectures and consider using classes for assumptions.

Here's how you can modify your code:\\n\\n```lean\\nimport Mathlib.Data.Finsupp.Defs\\nimport Mathlib.Data.Finset.Basic\\nimport Mathlib.Tactic.Convert\\n\\nstructure test where\\n  f: ℕ →₀ ℕ\\n  h: f.support.card = 2\\n\\ndef test.upd\\n  (t: test) (n: ℕ) (m: ℕ)\\n  (hin: n ∈ t.f.support) (hpos: ¬m=0): test :=\\n\\n  ⟨t.f.update n m,\\n    by\\n\\n      simp [Finsupp.update, hpos]\\n      have same: Finset.card (insert n t.f.support) = Finset.card t.f.support\\n        := by exact Finset.card_insert_of_mem hin\\n      convert same -- or do `convert ← same` to get the goal to be reversed, which looks better\\n      sorry\\n  ⟩\\n```\\n\\nThe `convert` tactic aligns the left-hand side of `same` with the left-hand side of the goal, creating new goals for any differences it can't resolve on its own.

Since it involves symmetric difference (`symmDiff`) and indexed unions (`iUnion`), a suitable place might be in the file handling set operations or boolean algebra properties. You can look into files like `data.set.basic` or `order.boolean_algebra` for similar lemmas.\\n\\n2. **Generalization to `iUnion`**: It is a good idea to generalize your lemma to work with `iUnion` as well. This makes the lemma more versatile and useful in a broader context. You can add both versions if they are not redundant.\\n\\n3. **Proof method**: Your proof by handling elements individually is perfectly fine. It is clear and understandable. However, you can also consider using existing lemmas to make it more concise. For instance, Yaël Dillies suggested that the first two steps can be done by a single lemma: `symmDiff_le_iff`.

              "   'answer': \"To address your question about working with `AEEq` functions and finding lemmas for equalities and inequalities, let's break down the solution:1. **Equality Lemma**: For the equality case, if you have `h : f = g`, you can simply rewrite the goal using `rw [h]`. This works because if `f` equals `g` everywhere, it implies they are equal almost everywhere (a.e.).   ```lean   example [MeasurableSpace α] (μ : Measure α) (f g : α →ₘ[μ] ℝ) (h : f = g) :       ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, f x = g x := by     rw [h]   ```2. **Inequality Lemma**: For the inequality case, the situation is more nuanced. The definition of `<` for `AEEqFun` is not straightforward. Specifically, `f < g` means `f ≤ g ∧ ¬g ≤ f`, which implies `f` is a.e. less than or equal to `g` and `f` is strictly less than `g` on a set of positive measure.    There is no direct lemma for `f < g` in the same way as for equality. Instead, you can use `LiftRel (·<·) f g` to express that `f` is a.e. less than `g`.   ```lean   example [MeasurableSpace α] (μ : Measure α) (f g : α →ₘ[μ] ℝ) (h : f < g) :       ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, f x < g x := by     -- Use LiftRel to express the a.e. inequality     sorry   ```3. **Source of Confusion**: The confusion arises from the definition of `<` for `AEEqFun` and the lack of a direct lemma for this relation. The definition involves both an a.e. component and a measure-positive component, making it less intuitive.4. **Resolution**: The issue is resolved by understanding the definition of `<` for `AEEqFun` and using `LiftRel` to express the a.e. inequality. This approach clarifies how to handle inequalities in the context of `AEEqFun`.By following these steps, you can effectively work with `AEEq` functions and handle both equalities and inequalities in your proofs.\",\n",

Lean needs an algorithm to determine whether the proposition (∃! (a ∈ A), a = tt) is true or false. While Lean can often infer such instances automatically, it sometimes struggles with more complex propositions like unique existence.To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:1. **Provide a Decidability Instance Manually**: You can explicitly supply the required decidability instance. This approach is more constructive and ensures that Lean can determine the truth value of the proposition.2. **Enable Classical Logic**: If you do not need to run the function constructively, you can enable classical logic in Lean. This can be done by including `open classical` at the beginning of your file or using `local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable`. This approach leverages the law of excluded middle to handle decidability automatically.Additionally, Kyle Miller suggested an alternative approach where you can change the equality into an `iff` (if and only if) statement, which might simplify the expression and avoid the need for a decidability instance.Here is an example of how you might enable classical logic:```leanopen classicaldef OR_spec (A : list bool) (out : bool) : Prop :=  out = (∃!

Instead, you can leverage the existing `Stream'` type from `Mathlib.Data.Stream.Defs`, which is defined as `def Stream' (α : Type u) := ℕ → α`.\\n\\nA more idiomatic way to achieve your goal is to use a subtype that ensures the property `R` is maintained between neighboring states.

When you use `List.map f`, Lean struggles to automatically prove that the recursion is well-founded because it cannot easily see that the size of the list is decreasing with each recursive call. This is why your custom function `mapAlt` works, as it explicitly shows the structural recursion.To resolve this, you can use `List.attach` to help Lean understand the well-foundedness of the recursion. Here is an example of how you can modify your `expr_subst` function to use `List.attach`:```leanimport Std.Data.Listinductive expr : Type -> Type| num  (n: Nat)                : expr Nat| var  (name: String)          : expr Nat| add  (e1 e2: expr Nat)       : expr Nat| pred (name: String)       (args: List (expr Nat)) : expr Boolopen exprdef expr_subst {α: Type} (subst_var: String) (subst: expr Nat) : expr α -> expr α| var v =>    if v = subst_var then      subst    else      var v| num n          => num n| add e1 e2      => add  (expr_subst subst_var subst e1) (expr_subst subst_var subst e2)| pred name args => pred name (List.map (fun ⟨x,_⟩ => expr_subst subst_var subst x) args.attach)```In this solution, `List.attach` pairs each element of the list with a proof that it belongs to the list. This additional information helps Lean's termination checker understand that the recursive calls are indeed decreasing the size of the list, thus proving termination.The main issue was that Lean's termination checker could not automatically prove that the recursion in `List.map` was well-founded. By using `List.attach`, you provide the necessary information for Lean to verify that the recursion is structurally decreasing, thus resolving the termination proof problem.\",\n",

By using the `classical` tactic, you enable Lean to use the axiom of choice to resolve this. This is a common approach when dealing with finite sets and subgroups in Lean.\\n\\nI hope this helps!

Is there another way, perhaps something that is idiomatic?\",\n",
              "  'answer': \"Hello Dan,\\n\\nThank you for your question. It looks like you're working through an interesting proof involving inequalities in Lean. Let's address your concern about the use of `calc` blocks and the `r = r` lines.\\n\\nIn your example, you have used `calc` blocks to establish intermediate steps in your proof. Specifically, you wrote:\\n\\n```\\ncalc\\n  r = r := by ring\\n  r ≤ 3 + s := by addarith[h1]\\n```\\n\\nand\\n\\n```\\ncalc\\n  r = r := by ring\\n  r ≤ 3 - s := by addarith[h2]\\n```\\n\\nWhile these lines are technically correct, they might feel redundant or unidiomatic. As Kevin Buzzard suggested, you can simplify your proof by directly using the `addarith` tactic without the need for a `calc` block when only one step is required. For example, you can write:\\n\\n```\\nhave h3 : r ≤ 3 + s := by addarith[h1]\\nhave h4 : r ≤ 3 - s := by addarith[h2]\\n```\\n\\nThis approach is more concise and idiomatic in Lean. The `calc` block is particularly useful when you need to chain together multiple steps that require different tactics. If a statement can be proved in one step, you can generally write the tactic directly without the scaffolding of a `calc` block.\\n\\nThis is a common point of confusion for beginners, as noted by Heather Macbeth and others in the conversation. Understanding when to use `calc` blocks versus direct tactics is an important mental leap in learning Lean. Adding a sentence or two in the early chapters of the book to clarify this could indeed save headaches for many learners.\\n\\nIn summary, if a proof step can be resolved with a single tactic, use that tactic directly. Reserve `calc` blocks for chaining together multiple steps. This will make your proofs cleaner and more idiomatic.\\n\\nI hope this helps!

For example, to type the 'for all' symbol (∀), you can type `\\\\forall`. For the 'greater than or equal to' symbol (≥), you can type `\\\\>=`, and it will automatically convert to the correct symbol. However, in Lean's math library (`mathlib`), it is recommended to use `\\\\le` for 'less than or equal to' (≤) instead of `\\\\>=` to avoid doubling the number of inequality lemmas.If you encounter a symbol in existing Lean code and want to know the shortcut, you can hover over the symbol to see its input method. Additionally, you can refer to the list of Unicode characters used in Julia, as many of them work in VS Code for Lean as well. For a comprehensive list of abbreviations, you can check the [abbreviations.json](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/src/abbreviation/abbreviations.json) file in the Lean VS Code extension repository.In summary, the main issue resolved here is how to input mathematical symbols in Lean using VS Code.

The image of the `log_embedding` is the ℤ-submodule called `unit_lattice K`. The first result is that the kernel of this map is the subgroup of `roots_of_unity` of `𝓤 K`: `lemma unit_lattice_kernel (x : 𝓤 K) : log_embedding K x = 0 ↔ x ∈ roots_of_unity K` where `roots_of_unity := comm_group.torsion (𝓤 K)`. Then, the main part is to prove that `unit_lattice K` is a free ℤ-module of rank `unit_rank K` with `unit_rank := fintype.card (infinite_place K) - 1`. The result is stated by first constructing the basis: `def unit_lattice.basis : Σ (n : ℕ), basis (fin n) ℤ (unit_lattice K)` and then proving it has the right cardinality: `lemma unit_lattice.dim : (unit_lattice.basis K).1 = unit_rank K`.

However, it faces significant challenges. Matthew Ballard pointed out that fullness is a significant requirement. Chris Hughes suggested a potential approach involving embedding `(C ⥤ Type)` into `Type 1` by sending `F` to `Hom (Terminal Object) F` and then composing this with Yoneda. However, Tanner Swett highlighted a critical issue: there exists a category with exactly one object and two endomorphisms, which would imply the existence of a type `a` with exactly two functions `a -> a`. This contradicts ordinary set theory, which asserts that no such type exists.Floris van Doorn provided a proof in Lean, using choice, to show that there is no type `α` such that `#(α → α) = 2`. Chris Hughes further demonstrated that choice is not necessary for this proof, as only `Quot.sound` is used, indicating that a very weak type theory would be required for the axiom to be consistent.Trebor Huang added that Lean implicitly assumes axiom K, and in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), the delooping of Z/2Z has exactly two endomorphisms, but the type of endomorphisms is not isomorphic to `Bool`, just has cardinality 2. Despite this, it is still impossible to achieve the other two-morphism-single-object category due to the constant map on inhabited objects.In summary, the main issue is that the proposed axiom leads to a contradiction with established set theory principles, specifically regarding the existence of a type with exactly two endomorphisms. The confusion arises from the assumption that such a type could exist, which is not supported by current mathematical frameworks.

But because it really is just a rather simple definition on top of an arbitrary preorder, I have a suspicion this could have a more general name that I don't know/don't recognize. I've so far tried looking into order-related things but didn't find anything (that was the likeliest place I thought of since it's a preorder, though actually making it an instance of a preorder would probably be a bad idea since it looks at a glance like it would likely conflict with the subset order on `Set α`).\",\n",
              "  'answer': \"Hi Ilmari, The concept you are referring to, where 'S₁ is minorized by S₂', can indeed be expressed in a more general and recognized form in Mathlib. Instead of defining a new concept, you can use the existing notion of the upper closure of a set. Specifically, you can write `S₁ ⊆ upperClosure S₂` to express that every element of `S₁` is less than or equal to some element of `S₂` in the preorder. This avoids the need to introduce a new definition and leverages the existing terminology and structures in Mathlib. This approach is more concise and aligns with the standard mathematical language used in the library. Thanks to Yaël Dillies for pointing this out, and I'm glad this resolves your query.\",\n",

              " 'answer': \"To call `simp` from meta code with a specific local hypothesis, you can use the following approach. First, you need to create a context for the `simp` tactic and then apply it to the desired location. Here's a detailed solution:1. Define a function to convert a list of lemma names into `SimpTheorems`:```leanopen Metaopen Lean.Metaopen Lean.Elab.Tacticdef simpTheoremsOfNames (lemmas : List Name) : MetaM SimpTheorems := do  lemmas.foldlM (·.addConst ·) (← simpOnlyBuiltins.foldlM (·.addConst ·) {})```2. Define a function to apply `simp` with the given lemmas to an expression:```leandef simpOnlyNames (lemmas : List Name) (e : Expr) : MetaM Simp.Result := do  (·.1) <$> simp e { simpTheorems := #[← simpTheoremsOfNames lemmas], congrTheorems := ← getSimpCongrTheorems }```3. If you need to apply `simp` at a specific location, you can use the `simpLocation` function. Here’s an example of how to create a `Simp.Context` and apply it:```leanlet ctx ← mkSimpContext (← `(tactic| simp only [foo])) falsesimpLocation ctx location```4. If you need to interpolate `Name`s or `FVarId`s into the tactic, you can convert them to `Syntax` and then evaluate the tactic:```leanif eqName ≠ `rfl then  let eq : Term ← (Expr.fvar (← getLocalDeclFromUserName eqName).fvarId).toSyntax  evalTactic (← `(tactic| simp only [← $eq] at *))```This approach resolves the issue of calling `simp` from meta code by providing a way to create the necessary context and apply the `simp` tactic at the desired location. The main source of confusion was how to handle the conversion of names and local declarations into a form that can be used within the `simp` tactic. By following the steps above, you can effectively call `simp` with specific hypotheses in meta code.\",\n",

Alternatively, you can use constructs that inherently require termination proofs. For example, instead of using 'while', you can use a recursive function with a well-founded relation to prove that it terminates.

Here is an example of how this can be done using `obtain` and tagged lemmas in Lean: ```lean theorem List.ne_nil_iff_exists {α : Type*} {xs : List α} : xs ≠ [] ↔ ∃ a as, xs = a :: as := by cases xs <;> simp theorem List.length_pos_iff_exists {α : Type*} {xs : List α} : 0 < xs.length ↔ ∃ a as, xs = a :: as := by rw [List.length_pos, List.ne_nil_iff_exists] example (l : List Nat) (h : 0 < l.length) : l = l.head! :: l.tail := by obtain ⟨x, xs, rfl⟩ := List.length_pos_iff_exists.mp h /- x : ℕ xs : List ℕ h : 0 < List.length (x :: xs) ⊢ x :: xs = List.head! (x :: xs) :: List.tail (x :: xs) -/ ``` The main issue resolved here is the lack of a tactic for direct decomposition of lists without knowing the lemma name. The source of confusion was how to rewrite a goal to a specific form and introduce local declarations. The issue was resolved by using the `obtain` tactic and tagging lemmas for automatic use, providing a structured and efficient approach to handle such decompositions.',\n",

Here is an example of how to use it effectively: \\n\\n```lean\\nlet X := something\\n-- some goal involving X\\n-- to replace X with 'something'\\ndsimp [X]\\n```\\n\\nThis approach works because `dsimp` unfolds the definition of `X` without performing other simplifications. However, `dsimp` is not the only way to achieve this. You can also use the `set` tactic, which allows you to introduce a hypothesis that equates the variable to its definition. For example:\\n\\n```lean\\nset X := something with hX\\n-- now you have a hypothesis hX: X = something\\nrw hX\\n```\\n\\nThis method is useful when you need to explicitly reference the equality in your proof. Additionally, if the goal involves proving `X = something`, you can use `rfl` since `let X := something` makes `X` definitionally equal to `something`. \\n\\nFor more information, you can refer to discussions on the Lean community forums, such as the thread on unfolding let expressions: [Zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How.20to.20unwrap.20a.20let.20expression).

              "  'answer': \"The 'cases' tactic in Lean is primarily used when the goal is a 'Prop', as it relies on the 'casesOn' method associated with inductive types, which is specialized for propositions. When the goal is not a 'Prop', such as when dealing with types like 'List' or 'Fin', the 'cases' tactic may not work due to type mismatches or other restrictions. In these situations, alternative approaches are necessary. For instance, you can use if-then-else chaining to handle different cases based on type equality. Here is an example of how to handle such cases elegantly without using 'cases':\\n\\n```lean\\ndef splitNoCases' {α β : Nat} (a : Fin α) (b : Fin β) (γ : Nat) (γ_def : γ ∈ [α, β]) : Fin γ :=\\n  if h : γ = α then\\n    Fin.cast h.symm a\\n  else if h' : γ = β then\\n    Fin.cast h'.symm b\\n  else\\n    by exfalso; simp at γ_def; tauto\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the 'if h : γ = α' construct is used to check if 'γ' is equal to 'α', and if so, 'Fin.cast h.symm a' is used to cast 'a' to the appropriate type. Similarly, 'if h' : γ = β' handles the case where 'γ' is equal to 'β'. If neither condition is met, the 'exfalso' tactic is used to derive a contradiction, leveraging 'simp' and 'tauto' to simplify and resolve the goal.\\n\\nThe main issue resolved here is the limitation of the 'cases' tactic when the goal is not a 'Prop'.

              "  'answer': \"To succinctly prove that two natural numbers are not equal in Lean, especially for large numbers, you can use tactics like `by decide` or `norm_num`, which are designed to handle decidable problems and numerical computations efficiently.

For more complex proofs, you can use tactics like `cases` to handle constructors and their injectivity.

Could some `simp` expert please take a look.\\\\n\\\\nThe issue is that there is a field `star_mul : ∀ r s : R, star (r * s) = star s * star r` and a theorem in the commutative case which avoids the skew:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntheorem star_mul\\' [CommSemigroup R] [StarSemigroup R] (x y : R) : star (x * y) = star x * star y := ...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBoth are marked `simp`. The linter complained that the left-hand side of `star_mul\\'` simplifies to `star y * star x`, which is because of the above field. I fixed this by moving the attribute statement to after the theorem.\",\\n  \"answer\": \"The main issue you encountered was that the linter complained about the left-hand side of `star_mul\\'` simplifying to `star y * star x` due to the `star_mul` field. This happened because both `star_mul` and `star_mul\\'` were marked as `simp`, causing a conflict in the simplification process.\\n\\nTo resolve this, you moved the `simp` attribute statement to after the `star_mul\\'` theorem. This change ensures that `star_mul\\'` has higher priority in the simplification process, thus avoiding the conflict and ensuring the correct behavior.\\n\\nHowever, there was some discussion about the stability and determinism of `simp` priorities. While some contributors suggested that the order in which `simp` applies lemmas is well-defined but complex, others recommended explicitly setting priorities to ensure the desired behavior. Explicitly setting priorities can help avoid relying on undocumented or heuristic-based behavior, which might change with the addition of new lemmas.\\n\\nIn summary, your fix by reordering the `simp` attribute statements is a valid solution, but for more robust control, explicitly setting priorities might be a better approach. This ensures that `star_mul\\'` consistently takes precedence over `star_mul` in the simplification process, avoiding potential conflicts and maintaining the intended behavior.\\n\\nKeywords: `simp`, `priority`, `star_mul`, `star_mul\\'`, `linter`, `simplification`, `conflict`, `resolution`, `explicit priority`\\n}'"

ZHAO Jiecheng: Hi @Kim Morrison, since the Array part has been added, let's talk about the ByteArray part. There are two points to it:\\n\\n\\n1. To speed up the calculation, the append operator in ByteArray is defined via `copeslice`. However, most proof utilities come from Array and List. So, I added an `append_to_data_append` theorem to connect them. Shall we put it in `std` or `lean`. [https://gist.github.com/JiechengZhao/d5dcafd2e34c38703c2e2d7bdcc4c4bd\\\\#file\\\\-arraytools\\\\-lean\\\\-L253](https://gist.github.com/JiechengZhao/d5dcafd2e34c38703c2e2d7bdcc4c4bd#file-arraytools-lean-L253)\\n2. When I write something, I feel it is common to pad zeros to a ByteArray. So, I also added some tools about it. But I am not sure if there are some better practices. [https://gist.github.com/JiechengZhao/d5dcafd2e34c38703c2e2d7bdcc4c4bd\\\\#file\\\\-arraytools\\\\-lean\\\\-L81](https://gist.github.com/JiechengZhao/d5dcafd2e34c38703c2e2d7bdcc4c4bd#file-arraytools-lean-L81)\\n. Kim Morrison: Sorry, large gists take a long time to read and work out what you're wanting to do. Could you give a briefer summary here?\\n\\n. ZHAO Jiecheng: 1. Add this to somewhere\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ntheorem ByteArray.append_eq_data_append {a b: ByteArray}: a ++ b = {data := a.data ++ b.data} := by\\n\\n```\\n\\n2. Add some utils like this:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ndef ByteArray.zeros (n : Nat) : ByteArray :=\\n  (double_until n {data := #[0, 0, 0, 0]: ByteArray} (by decide)).extract 0 n\\n\\ntheorem ByteArray.zeros_get_zero (h : i < n)\\n  : (ByteArray.zeros n)[i]'(by rw [zeros_size] ; exact h) = 0 := by\\n\\n@[simp]\\ntheorem ByteArray.zeros_size: (zeros n).size = n := by\\n\\n```\\n. Kim Morrison: Should the first one not be `(a ++ b).data = ...`?\\n\\n. ZHAO Jiecheng: Kim Morrison [said](#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/.28Byte.29Array.20lemmas/near/434264030):\\n\\n\\n\\n> Should the first one not be `(a ++ b).data = ...`?\\n\\n\\nThey should be the same. However, I think when you rewrite something in ByteArray, `(a ++ b)` would be more convenient to use because there is no need to rewrite the ByteArray to Array first.\\n\\n. Kim Morrison: I'm skeptical that it would even be a good idea to rewrite by `append_eq_data_append` as written.\\n\\n. Kim Morrison: For your second point, there is no `double_until`, so I presume you are suggesting adding a bunch of other stuff. Start with that?\\n\\n.

Start with that?\\n\\n\\nAlright. Should I add that to Mathlib first?\\n\\n. Kim Morrison: Sure, open a PR, or describe here.\\n\\n. Kim Morrison: Could you link the existing `append_eq_data_append`? I can't find it.\\n\\n. ZHAO Jiecheng: double util looks like this, it simply flatten the current bytearray and truncate it to the desired length. :\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ndef ByteArray.double_until (n: Nat) (d: ByteArray) (h: d.size > 0) : ByteArray :=\\n    if hd: d.size ≥ n then d\\n    else\\n      have : n - ByteArray.size (d ++ d) < n - ByteArray.size d := by\\n        rw [size_append_eq]\\n        rw [Nat.sub_add_eq]\\n        apply Nat.sub_lt\\n        exact tsub_pos_iff_not_le.mpr hd\\n        exact h\\n      have : (d ++ d).size > 0 := by\\n        rw [size_append_eq]\\n        simp\\n        exact h\\n      double_until n (d ++ d) this\\ntermination_by _ => n - d.size\\n\\n```\\n. Kim Morrison: Both of your `have`s can finish by `omega` a few steps earlier, I think. :\\\\-)\\n\\n. Kim Morrison: I'd like to be a bit more convinced of the end uses of these utilities first before adding them to the core Lean API. Either lets discuss that, or perhaps send these to Std for now.\\n\\n. ZHAO Jiecheng: Sorry, the `append_eq_data_append` is a lemma I wrapped for convenience. The original version is here. It looks like what you suggested: [https://leanprover\\\\-community.github.io/mathlib4\\\\_docs/Init/Data/Array/Lemmas.html\\\\#Array.appendList\\\\_data](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Init/Data/Array/Lemmas.html#Array.appendList_data)\\n\\n. Kim Morrison: Okay, yeah, I am unconvinced by the usefulness of your new versions.\\n\\n. ZHAO Jiecheng: Here is why I introduce `zeros` in my implementation of a memory: when you retrieve something from memory but exceed the current size, the result is padded with zeros to ensure the `get` function returns the desired size of content. When you set something to memory but the current memory is too short, the ByteArray is extended to the desired length first. I guess this would be common for people wanting to mimic memory in Lean.\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nabbrev Memory := ByteArray\\n\\nnamespace Memory\\n\\ndef get_helper (data: Memory) (offset size: Nat) : ByteArray :=\\n  data.extract offset (offset + size) ++\\n    ByteArray.zeros (min (offset + size - data.size) size)\\n\\ndef get (data : Memory) (offset size: U256) : ByteArray :=\\n  get_helper data offset.val size.val\\n\\n\\ndef set_helper (self: Memory) (offset : Nat) (value: ByteArray) (target_size: Nat)\\n  : Memory :=\\n  let value_ := if value.size < target_size\\n    then (value ++ ByteArray.zeros (target_size - value.size))\\n    else value\\n  let data_ := if self.size < offset + target_size\\n    then (self ++ ByteArray.zeros (offset + target_size - self.size))\\n    else self\\n  value_.copySlice 0 data_ offset target_size\\n\\ndef set (self: Memory) (offset : U256) (value: ByteArray) (target_size: U256)\\n  : Memory :=\\n  set_helper self offset.val value target_size.val\\n\\nend Memory\\n\\n```\\n. ZHAO Jiecheng: I guess you are right, almost no reference of `appendList_data` in mathlib and std.\\n\\n.

Resizing an array is a better idea, especially if you can assign a different default value.\\n\\n\\nI will add my current code to a PR first. Though it is not we want now but we can start there.\\n\\n. Timo Carlin-Burns: For the use case of creating an array of all 0s, is there a reason to construct such an array by doubling? It seems like it would be better to have a function `Array.replicate` which is analogous to [docs\\\\#List.replicate](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=List.replicate#doc) and constructs the array via repeated applications of `Array.push`\\n\\n. Timo Carlin-Burns: I expect doubling to have much worse performance as it has to create new allocations at each iteration. `Array.push` can re\\\\-use the same allocation, especially if you start with `Array.mkEmpty n` to set the appropriate initial capacity\\n\\n.

This can be confusing for beginners because it seems like `rw` should be able to rewrite in all contexts. The `simp_rw` tactic, on the other hand, uses the `simp` tactic internally, which employs different techniques that allow it to rewrite under binders more reliably. This is because `simp` can use functional extensionality (`funext`) to navigate into subexpressions within binders, something `rw` cannot do as effectively. However, `simp` can only rewrite one thing at a time, which can be a limitation in cases involving complicated dependent types. Additionally, in Lean's type theory, functional extensionality does not hold without an additional axiom (`quot.sound`), which is necessary for rewriting under a lambda. This distinction is crucial for understanding why `rw` and `simp_rw` behave differently and how to use them appropriately in different contexts.

This notation helps in reducing the need for excessive parentheses in expressions, making the code more readable.

              "  'answer': \"In Lean, the 'partial' keyword is used to indicate that a function is directly recursive and may not terminate.

In the provided code snippet:\\n\\n```lean\\ndef loops : IO Unit := do\\n  while true do\\n    pure ()\\n```\\n\\nThe function 'loops' does not call itself directly, so it does not need to be marked as 'partial'. The 'while' loop itself is defined using a partial function, but since 'loops' only calls this definition and does not involve direct recursion, the 'partial' keyword is not required.\\n\\nTo ensure that functions terminate, you can use tail-recursion and provide a manual proof of termination. Alternatively, you can use constructs that inherently require termination proofs. For example, instead of using 'while', you can use a recursive function with a well-founded relation to prove that it terminates. Here is an example of how you might rewrite the 'loops' function to ensure termination:\\n\\n```lean\\ndef loops (n : Nat) : IO Unit :=\\n  if n = 0 then\\n    pure ()\\n  else\\n    loops (n - 1)\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the function 'loops' takes a natural number 'n' and decrements it with each recursive call, ensuring that it eventually terminates when 'n' reaches zero.

              " 'answer': 'To perform string slicing in Lean similar to Python\\'s `s[:7]`, you can use the `Substring` type. Here is an example of how to create a substring from the start of a string up to the 7th character index using `Substring` and `String.Pos` for indexing: \\n\\n```lean\\nlet s₂ : Substring := ⟨s, ⟨0⟩, ⟨7⟩⟩\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, `s` is the original string, and `⟨0⟩` and `⟨7⟩` are the starting and ending positions, respectively, wrapped in `String.Pos`. To simplify the notation, you can define an instance of `OfNat` for `String.Pos`:\\n\\n```lean\\ninstance : OfNat String.Pos x where\\n  ofNat := {\\n    byteIdx := x\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nWith this instance, you can write the substring creation more concisely:\\n\\n```lean\\nlet s₂ : Substring := ⟨s, 0, 7⟩\\n```\\n\\nFor joining an array or list of strings, you can use the `String.intercalate` function, which works similarly to Python\\'s `\\'-\\'.join(a)`. Here is an example:\\n\\n```lean\\nlet joinedString := String.intercalate \"-\" [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\\n```\\n\\nThis will produce the string `\"a-b-c\"`. The main issue resolved here is how to perform string slicing and joining in Lean, similar to Python. The source of confusion was the lack of direct slice notation and the appropriate function for joining strings. The issue was resolved by using `Substring` for slicing and `String.intercalate` for joining, along with defining an instance to simplify the notation for creating substrings.',\n",

You can find the relevant code [here](https://github.com/b-mehta/unit-fractions//blob/b60c39a3ebd40a84104a4064840b10fc2af15fb8/src/for_mathlib/basic_estimates.lean#L282). It would be helpful to contact Bhavik Mehta or Thomas Bloom for the current status of this code and whether it has been ported to Lean4 and/or Mathlib.\\n\\nRegarding the formalization of the reduction of PNT to Wiener-Ikehara, if you already have the meromorphic continuation of the zeta function around 1 and know that it has a simple pole at 1, you can derive the existence of the Euler-Mascheroni constant using complex analysis. Specifically, the removable singularity theorem can be applied, as detailed in the Mathlib documentation [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/RemovableSingularity.html).\\n\\nAlthough Mathlib currently lacks extensive support for meromorphic functions, the analyticity and non-zero nature of the completed zeta function at s=1 should suffice. You can rewrite `-deriv riemannZeta z / riemannZeta z - 1 / (z - 1)` as the negative log derivative of `fun z ↦ (Λ z) * (z-1)` plus some terms that are analytic at `z=1`. The analyticity of the renormalized completed zeta function `Λ₀` ensures that `(Λ z) * (z-1)` is analytic and non-zero at `z=1`, which is sufficient for your purposes.\\n\\nFor further progress, you might want to follow up on the ongoing work on meromorphic functions in Mathlib, as discussed in the Lean community.

This choice is not just a theoretical preference but also has practical implications in computer science, particularly in algorithm design and implementation. For example, in programming languages like C, the modulo operation is defined to produce a remainder that is consistent with the 'least positive residue' convention. This consistency is important for writing efficient and predictable code.

              "  \"To show that a module M over a k-algebra A is also a vector space over k, you need to ensure that Lean can infer the necessary structures. The issue arises because Lean cannot deduce what H is from the goal `Module F M`. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:\\n\\n1. **Instance Definition**: You cannot directly define an instance for `Module F M` because Lean cannot infer H from the goal. Instead, you can use the `RestrictScalars.module` or `Module.compHom` definitions from mathlib, which are designed for such cases.\\n\\n2. **Using `IsScalarTower`**: The usual way in mathlib to handle such situations is to use the `IsScalarTower` typeclass.

When you tried to use `rw [← Nat.card_eq_fintype_card] at hQ`, Lean couldn't synthesize the `Fintype` instance for `{ x // x ∈ ↑Q }` automatically. This is because Lean needs to know how to decide membership in `Q` to construct the `Fintype` instance.\\n\\nTo resolve this, you can use the `classical` tactic, which allows Lean to use the axiom of choice to decide membership in `Q`.

This resolves the issue because `G` is finite, and Lean can now synthesize the required `Fintype` instance.\\n\\nRegarding the relation between `Finite` and `Fintype`, `Fintype` is a type class that provides a finite enumeration of the elements of a type, while `Finite` is a weaker notion that only asserts the existence of such an enumeration without providing it explicitly. The `Fintype.ofFinite` function can noncomputably obtain a `Fintype` instance from a `Finite` instance using the axiom of choice.\\n\\nIf you want to understand `classical` and related concepts like 'noncomputable', 'axiom of choice', 'decidable', and 'excluded middle' better, you might want to read about classical logic versus constructive logic.

              "  'answer': \"Certainly! Here is a minimal example in Lean that demonstrates the issue with rewriting along equality of functors. The code snippet below attempts to use the `rw` tactic to rewrite along an equality of functors, but it fails because the motive is not type correct. This illustrates the problem clearly: \\n\\n```lean\\nimport Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Functor.Category\\n\\nnamespace CategoryTheory\\n\\nvariable {C D E : Type _} [Category C] [Category D] [Category E] (F G : C ⥤ D) (H : D ⥤ E)\\n\\nexample {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) (h : F ⋙ H = G ⋙ H) [IsIso (H.map (F.map f))] :\\n    IsIso (H.map (G.map f)) := by\\n  rw [← Functor.comp_map]\\n  rw [← h] -- tactic 'rewrite' failed, motive is not type correct\\n  dsimp\\n  infer_instance\\n\\nend CategoryTheory\\n```\\n\\nThe main issue here is that in dependent type theory, equality is defined as an inductive type. The principle that if `x = y` then `P(x) = P(y)` (known as the substitution property of equality) is an axiom in Lean. When checking that a diagram commutes, you can't simply 'unravel everything' because you encounter something for which there is no definition and which you can't 'evaluate' or 'unfold'. This is particularly problematic when dealing with equality of functors, as it involves a lot of equality of types. If the proof of equality isn't `refl`, you run into issues where terms of different types cannot be coerced into one another. Instead of trying to make the equality work, it is often more practical to use an isomorphism and prove theorems about this isomorphism. This approach avoids the complications arising from the dependently-typed structure of categories and the need for definitional equality.\",\n",

              "\"The `rw` tactic in Lean does allow rewriting under quantifiers, but it has a specific limitation: the rewritten term cannot reference any of the bound variables within the quantifier. This can be confusing for beginners because it seems like `rw` should be able to rewrite in all contexts. The `simp_rw` tactic, on the other hand, uses the `simp` tactic internally, which employs different techniques that allow it to rewrite under binders more reliably. This is because `simp` can use functional extensionality (`funext`) to navigate into subexpressions within binders, something `rw` cannot do as effectively. However, `simp` can only rewrite one thing at a time, which can be a limitation in cases involving complicated dependent types. Additionally, in Lean's type theory, functional extensionality does not hold without an additional axiom (`quot.sound`), which is necessary for rewriting under a lambda. This distinction is crucial for understanding why `rw` and `simp_rw` behave differently and how to use them appropriately in different contexts. For more detailed explanations, you can refer to discussions on the Lean community forums or consider creating a FAQ page for quick reference.\""
